Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart. So, now I have mine own again, be gone, That I might strive to kill it with a groan. We make woe wanton with this fond delay: Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish! he was not born to shame: Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit; For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd Sole monarch of the universal earth. O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
But, more of thy news? Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no question asked him by any of the senators, but they stand bald before him:
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn, And make a dearth in this revolting land. Or shall we play the wantons with our woes, And make some pretty match with shedding tears? As thus, to drop them still upon one place, Till they have fretted us a pair of graves Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
The desirous party was upset when their partner would not play.
Teenager: Mom, can I stay out after curfew? Mother: Not on your life.
I layed the smack down on that chick.
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind. Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries: Didst thou not kill this king? I grant ye.
Man you are a cookie.
Indeed, you shall not. Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum, See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair, As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him: Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus: 'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear, Though you were born in Rome:

I'll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram, That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him--dead-- Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd. Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it;

Bud she wants but she doesn't know how to ask for it.
I would they were barbarians--as they are, Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not, Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol-- Be gone; Put not your worthy rage into your tongue; One time will owe another.

He the site's worst troll , but IRL he's a lawyer.
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst? As in a theatre, the eyes of men, After a well-graced actor leaves the stage, Are idly bent on him that enters next, Thinking his prattle to be tedious;

Why do you have to be such a dope?
She lives to hit the pookie.
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it light. O, who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus? Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast?
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter: I would to God all strifes were well compounded. My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty To take our brother Clarence to your grace. Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this To be so bouted in this royal presence? Who knows not that the noble duke is dead? You do him injury to scorn his corse.
Pardon my French , I'm pretty angry.
Oh, he's just bitching about his boss.
Ay, my good lord. I' fecks! Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast smutch'd thy nose? They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
How dost thou feel thyself now? 'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
I, even I: what think you of it, madam? How canst thou woo her?
O, what cause have I, Thine being but a moiety of my grief, To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries! Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death; How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
A good demand. Why force you this?
But new struck nine. Ay me! sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Our band mostly covers Led Zeppelin songs.

Hey dude , let's go gank some poor noob.
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself To answer mildly; for they are prepared With accusations, as I hear, more strong Than are upon you yet. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go: Let them accuse me by invention, I Will answer in mine honour.
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast. Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause, And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt. Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight: O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear, That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast! Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife With her companion grief must end her life.
which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog. Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it. I have no brother, I am like no brother; And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine, Be resident in men like one another And not in me: I am myself alone. Clarence, beware;

IMAO , this idea is stupid.

You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice. O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out, To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: I something do excuse the thing I hate, For his advantage that I dearly love.

I'm skipping out on work today.
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee: That which in mean men we intitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts. What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life, The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
Person A: Be easy , dude . Person B: Yeah, you too.
If you dance with Mary Jane , you'll get your toes stepped on.

Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!-- Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me: but, as I said, On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood, Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres; For who lived king, but I could dig his grave? And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow? Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! My parks, my walks, my manors that I had. Even now forsake me, and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body's length.
I just beat your high score in guitar hero... FACE!

She is bare pretty.
The sun will not be seen to-day; The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. I would these dewy tears were from the ground. Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

Person A: So back in aught five... Person B: CSB.
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs. But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;

My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs: By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts I often have endured.

Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties;

Benedicite! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Young son, it argues a distemper'd head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:

Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke, And all your northern castles yielded up, And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party. Thou hast said enough. Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair! What say you now? what comfort have we now?
That's my bull.
You could tell that was a weave - it looks so sham.
Our plan didn't work. It all went tits up.
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, And give them friendly welcome every one: Let them want nothing that my house affords. Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page, And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady: That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber; And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear. Which in his greatest need will shrink from him. All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march: True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings: Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

Ho'Bah ! Mahalo for being so supportive of us!
I am inform'd that he comes towards London, To set the crown once more on Henry's head: Guess thou the rest; There shall I rest secure from force and fraud. Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly: If Warwick take us we are sure to die. 3 KING HENRY VI
Dan thinks that Asian girl is HLW.
She is so pressed over him.
Damn , that girl has huge tracts of land.
True; save means to live. Of that there's none, or little.
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric. What say you to a piece of beef and mustard? A dish that I do love to feed upon.
My posse 's chillin like villains.
Po po!
He is always fucking around on his computer.
Banished, sir. You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
I don't want to end up in the jug.
She is always such a crack-head.
Watch out for Jim - he's such a drunk hosebag. I hear he has crabs and considers them his 'little pets'.
Get me out of this Helmet Party!
I just totaled my Merc.
This is great X - I've been blowing up all night.
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes! My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets! If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fix'd in doom perpetual, Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother's lamentation!
You're looking scarlet tonight!
It's all about that skrill.
Yo , he a straight up and down snitch.
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day! Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Oh fricka fracka.
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
Hey man , I have to go home. I just sharted myself and need to change my pants.
Donna came out of her shell after she joined a singing group at school.

My lord, Is this the daughter of a king? She is, When once she is my wife.
'Bubba says he's gonna merc ya, man.' 'Don't sweat it, that nigga got a glass jaw .'

I sloshed my way through the park in the rain.
She's got a huge bust.
This is a cunty question.
Dude , I totally tanked that quantum mechanics test.
Hey guys , I got a piece of her punani.
Why are you beasting?
I'm leaving man. Holla.
That watch is yours? You're shitting me!
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news. Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as will thaw.
I'm sporting my new jacket.
Nay, but speak not maliciously. I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud;
lay it on me; And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith, To feast and sport us at thy father's house. Go, call my men, and let us straight to him; And bring our horses unto Long-lane end; There will we mount, and thither walk on foot Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock, And well we may come there by dinner-time.
She's still hung up on the fact that I cheated on her.
She was throwed at the party last night.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work; For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
He's totally fuck struck.
The main reason I'm not a wedlocker is because weddings are so expensive
I'm going to cut out.
She opened up her flower to me.
Cunnilingus preformed while the receiver is taking a shit.
Hey, you got any lip shit?
A call was made to the police department to check on a slumper behind a bar.

Bid a sick man in sadness make his will: Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill! In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Oh gross, that made me want to cack.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen. God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
Stop being fuckin gully son!
What do ye talk? Have we not had a taste of his obedience? Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come. Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd In bolted language; meal and bran together He throws without distinction.
While you were sleeping, we all gave you a teabag.
I may have to bite the bullet and turn myself in to the police.
Depends on if you mainline it.
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down: Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow, And with the other fling it at thy face, Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, That seem'd in eating him to hold him up, Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke, I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green. What, are they dead?
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done. The most arch of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of. 'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes: ' 'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another Within their innocent alabaster arms: Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
He's out cold.
He just stepped on a mud duck.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Ay, and for an assault too. O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants. Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down. Let them lay by their helmets and their spears, And both return back to their chairs again: Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound While we return these dukes what we decree.
and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, For I have none: let no man speak again To alter this, for counsel is but vain. My liege, one word.
Fashion and accessories are my kryptonite.
Was ever son so rued a father's death? Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
The pigs got my brother for robbery.
The citizens of Corioli have issued, And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle: I saw our party to their trenches driven, And then I came away. Though thou speak'st truth, Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?
Nay, nothing; all is said His tongue is now a stringless instrument; Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
He's a cock spank.
I said "hi" to him and he said, " Shut up , asshole , ur gay ." What a douche bag.
Let's keep this on the DL " (so the parents won't find out).
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
She was babelicious.
What a cool car! Yeapers!
He's gotta pay his cell phone bill by today or it'll get shut off.
Loved the tongue action!
Joe was pulling brodies in the high school lot.
Let's all go get geeked.
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o' life, for then we are sure they are true. Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and toads carbonadoed.
I'm not as kewl as she thinks I am.
She drank detergent and went Tatum.
The people in Las Vegas are so lametarded.
That conspiracy theory is complete bollocks.
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. Many years of happy days befal My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
For one commanding all, obey'd of none. Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about, And left thee but a very prey to time; Having no more but thought of what thou wert, To torture thee the more, being what thou art. Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
'Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress.' What a pestilent knave is this same!
'Save your honour! From thee, even from thy virtue! What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter or the tempted, who sins most? Ha! Not she: nor doth she tempt:
Look at that r/tard mage!
That party was all hype.
That's so snizzo you got the bud.
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio. But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger: may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming? Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, That, being a stranger in this city here, Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
My sovereign, with the loving citizens, Like to his island girt in with the ocean, Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, Shall rest in London till we come to him. Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. Farewell, my sovereign.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball; My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me: But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news? Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack- saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
Hey, don't let her Yoko Ono us, man.
Let's get some natty light and go to the river.
I can't stand my brother-in-law. He always acts like his shit doesn't stink.
Jam it in there.
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff. But how did you desire it should be made?
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause, And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen, That led calm Henry, though he were a king, As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust, Command an argosy to stem the waves.
In him there is a hope of government, That in his nonage council under him, And in his full and ripen'd years himself, No doubt, shall then and till then govern well. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Speaker: That chick is hot! Response: Yeah, but she's jail bait.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did! O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show!
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees; The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, And chattering pies in dismal discords sung. Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope, To wit, an indigested and deformed lump, Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.

ILY so much.
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition. Condition! I would I were a Roman; for I cannot, Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition! What good condition can a treaty find I' the part that is at mercy?
Happy return be to your royal grace! Many and hearty thankings to you both. We have made inquiry of you; and we hear Such goodness of your justice, that our soul Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks, Forerunning more requital.
That was a gnarly car wreck.
We're going to have a Q & A session after the presentation.
Nice threads.
I was once before him for getting a wench with child. Did you such a thing?
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms? To help King Edward in his time of storm, As every loyal subject ought to do.
I went to their chapter's house. They have photos covering the downstairs area. Sorority squats everywhere.
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair. One day too late, I fear me, noble lord, Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth: O, call back yesterday, bid time return, And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
now I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave. Go, do our bidding; hence!
La you now, you hear: When she will take the rein I let her run; But she'll not stumble. Good my liege, I come;
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another, for tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling! An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
Kill the Klinks!
Man, we're about to get home, don't get wooked-out on the nuggets.
The promotion was good. Access to the company jet? Icing on the cake.
Come over tonight and we'll herf these Montecristos.

Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. that they have seemed to be together, though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves!
They were doing some mad scrumping last night.

In your lord's scale is nothing but himself, And some few vanities that make him light; But in the balance of great Bolingbroke, Besides himself, are all the English peers, And with that odds he weighs King Richard down. Post you to London, and you will find it so;
If it be so, then both depart to him; I rather wish you foes than hollow friends: But if you mind to hold your true obedience, Give me assurance with some friendly vow, That I may never have you in suspect.
I thought we'd be together as a couple, but she friend zoned me.

She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel! O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Lords, you that here are under our arrest, Procure your sureties for your days of answer. Little are we beholding to your love, And little look'd for at your helping hands. Alack, why am I sent for to a king, Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:

I got broke when I crashed on my skateboard.
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man, Came on the part of York, press'd by his master; And I, who at his hands received my life, him Have by my hands of life bereaved him. Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did! And pardon, father, for I knew not thee! My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks; And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
He just went bonkers.

I have advertised him by secret means That if about this hour he make his way Under the colour of his usual game, He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
Look at dem huge babaloonies.
'Tis death for any one in Mantua To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke, For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him, Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
consider little What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue, May drop upon his kingdom and devour Incertain lookers on. What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well? What holier than, for royalty's repair, For present comfort and for future good, To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to't?
I don't give a flying fuck.
if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt.

That chick we saw on lake street was a straight up skag.
God give us leisure for these rites of love! Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well! Good lords, conduct him to his regiment: I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap, Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow, When I should mount with wings of victory:

As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done;
Person A: Your new profile picture is so cute! Person B: Thanks! Person A: YW.

I call thee not. I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
Sweet sister, let me live: What sin you do to save a brother's life, Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtue. O you beast! O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch! Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? Is't not a kind of incest, to take life From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses: lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice.
You're my kryptonite.

Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours And added years to his short banishment, He should have had a volume of farewells; But since it would not, he had none of me. He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt, When time shall call him home from banishment, Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.

Jim said Cheryl was a thief, but I think he was just trying to feed me some sour fruit.

Let's be calm. The people are abused; set on. This paltering Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely I' the plain way of his merit.
While we pursued the horsemen of the north, He slily stole away and left his men: Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland, Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat, Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself, Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast, Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
It's boring living out in the boonies.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins, That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnable. What we will do, we do upon command.
This is straight-up what she told me...
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived From some forefather grief; mine is not so, For nothing had begot my something grief; Or something hath the nothing that I grieve: 'Tis in reversion that I do possess; But what it is, that is not yet known; what I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
Wow! That song just gives me eargasms.
Are you wearing a merkin?
A little fire is quickly trodden out; Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war; Those will I muster up:
Go fuck yourself in the ass , you twat -faced cunthole!
Speaker: Who was that guy you were talking to at the bar? Response: No idea. It was just some random that sat down next to me.
She derbed him last night.
You are a lame ass person.

My boy came across a thousand dollars, so he broke me off.
He talks like he's squeezin' a steamer!
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee; He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
Could you guestimate how long it'll take you to finish the project?
Why, that was he. The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
or whether nature, Not to be other than one thing, not moving From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controll'd the war; but one of these-- As he hath spices of them all, not all, For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd, So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit, To choke it in the utterance.
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke. The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, Thou call'dst me king.
Do you not hear me speak? I do; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open;
I will then give it you soundly. What will you give us?
Let's go cut a rug.
Don't act like such a gump!

She is a jump down.
I dasn't do what you say to do.
That think-tank only hires cranks . I wouldn't listen to anything they say, if I were you.
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. Which of you, if you were a prince's son, Being pent from liberty, as I am now, if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, Would not entreat for life? My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
I am a poor fellow, sir. Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange;

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage: when and where and how We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, That thou consent to marry us to-day.
And tells us, what occasion of import Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife, And sent you hither so unlike yourself? Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear: Sufficeth I am come to keep my word, Though in some part enforced to digress;
That hoodie is cold with it!
Whose tongue? Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
O, no more, no more! You have said you will not grant us any thing; For we have nothing else to ask, but that Which you deny already: yet we will ask; That, if you fail in our request, the blame May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
Let's kick it!

My parents totally ate it.
That's a preppy store.
She's staring at his tackle.
Tut, tut! Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle: I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.' In an ungracious mouth is but profane. Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground? But then more 'why?

I saw that new exchange student in the locker room. He was hooded!
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint? From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty: As surfeit is the father of much fast, So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint.
You will not, then? No.
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus: Your brother and his lover have embraced: As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
My sister Athena is a hoss.
The yellow hammers were getting out of control at the Catfish Festival.
 We cannot weigh our brother with ourself: Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them, But in the less foul profanation.
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so. Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace, With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days! Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, That would reduce these bloody days again, And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Do you know anywhere we can score some special K?
That guy left us feeling discombopulated.
I'm hanging out with my girlfriends this weekend.
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads: if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
the painful service, The extreme dangers and the drops of blood Shed for my thankless country are requited But with that surname; a good memory, And witness of the malice and displeasure Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;

Having a party it is.
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African; Where she at least is banish'd from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
For what offence? The sum of all I can, I have disclosed; Why or for what these nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed: An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus; Thy father, Minos, that denied our course; The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life. Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the king; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier. Leave your prating: since these good men are pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.
Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold, Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola? He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
Girl you need to Diva Up you have to kill them in that presentation today.
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it. I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say. Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow; points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by the gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
Boy, you should just shut your mouth; you're diggin' a hole!
I am going to raise in a couple of minutes.
He can choose to end his state of sexlessness since he's a volcel rather than an incel.
Those shoes are filthy!
That was some quality food.
This situation is a real fuster cluck.
Sorry for the potato quality photos of the birthday party.
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier, so, To have my praise for this, perform a part Thou hast not done before. Well, I must do't: Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit!
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot; For then this land was famously enrich'd With politic grave counsel; then the king Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace. Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
A friend of mine drives a sweet rice-rocket.
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause! Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
He can decide what he wants - he still needs to brainfuck it some more.
Man, that is a kick ass party!
Man I'm ready to go. Let's shake the spot.
Lay't so to his charge: He's with the king your father. Who? Camillo?
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life; O, then began the tempest to my soul, Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood, With that grim ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
We need to find some snapper tonight.
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and then come back to my master's as soon as I can. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
The mugger was apprehended by a have-a-go hero making a citizen's arrest.
This hamburger is fan-fucking-tastic.
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious. And must she die for this? O, let her live, And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty; Slander myself as false to Edward's bed; Throw over her the veil of infamy:
Check out the mug on that guy.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 
I can't believe that hodger ate all the cookies and drank all of the milk!
Use a condom, or you might get one past the goalie.
Look at those noonies.
We liked that place fo ' sheezy!
Look, the unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. Come away;
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame: I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands, Nor posted off their suits with slow delays; My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds, My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs, My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
Look at that hoodrat clinging on that dude!
She needs a bikini wax. Her muff is out of control.
where the dull tribunes, That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods Our Rome hath such a soldier. ' Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast, Having fully dined before.
She's like a lumberjack.
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.

For Christ's sake ! How could you already have another parking ticket?
Why do you keep stressing me about that?
Yeah, so apparently I was outed by People magazine. Even though I'm not gay.
for honour, 'Tis a derivative from me to mine, And only that I stand for. I appeal To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes Came to your court, how I was in your grace, How merited to be so; since he came, With what encounter so uncurrent I Have strain'd to appear thus:
And let them die that age and sullens have; For both hast thou, and both become the grave. I do beseech your majesty, impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him: He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.

Are you down to drink tonight and rack it?
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly. Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds: Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd; And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.

Blossom, speed thee well! There lie, and there thy character: there these; Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch, That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot, But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly. Well, bring our lady hither to our sight; And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale. Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands? O, how we joy to see your wit restored! O, that once more you knew but what you are! These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
Those bolts have gunk all over them.
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't: With whispering and most guilty diligence, In action all of precept, he did show me The way twice o'er. Are there no other tokens Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

We will meet them, And help the joy. Behold our patroness, the life of Rome! Call all your tribes together, praise the gods, And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:

I look so ratchet in that photo.
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak; And speak I will; I am no child, no babe: Your betters have endured me say my mind, And if you cannot, best you stop your ears. My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, Or else my heart concealing it will break, And rather than it shall, I will be free Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

Towards him I made, but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood: I, measuring his affections by my own, That most are busied when they're most alone, Pursued my humour not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
Give me your hand, And let the subject see, to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus, You must walk by us on our other hand; And good supporters are you.
They choose their magistrate, And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' His popular 'shall' against a graver bench Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself! It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches To know, when two authorities are up, Neither supreme, how soon confusion May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other.
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down. That's my office.

Why, that is spoken like a toward prince. Royal commanders, be in readiness: For with a band of thirty thousand men Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York; And in the towns, as they do march along, Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard; And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour; None else of name and noble estimate. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

A dire induction am I witness to, And will to France, hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical. Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here? Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes! My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
our gates, Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes; They'll open of themselves. Hark you. far off! There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes Amongst your cloven army. O, they are at it!
There have been, Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now; nay, there's comfort in't Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd, As mine, against their will.

How now! is he dead already? or is it fear That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch That trembles under his devouring paws; And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey, And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.

Of course he was butthurt when I pointed out he was a frothing radical. And a bitch.
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness, My women may be with me; for you see My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools; There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress Has deserved prison, then abound in tears As I come out: this action I now go on Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord: I never wish'd to see you sorry;
But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. Come, come with me, and we will make short work; For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one.

I've been pushing a hack too long not to see through that line.
What's the drill?
I gotta coil one.

Say no more: Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault I' the boldness of your speech. I am sorry for't: All faults I make, when I shall come to know them, I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd To the noble heart.

We are going to Cali on vacation.
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.
Mom! Levi won't stop being a copy-cat!
Quit hawkin' me!
the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake. My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason?
Hey! Shup.
That was the poorest dunk I've ever seen.
The film is a bit pez to be honest.
She is wacked ! How could she not know that?
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that: an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
The replay feature in Drift Hunters is amazing. I love watching my drifts and analyzing my performance. It helps me identify areas for improvement and refine my technique. It's a valuable tool for any serious player looking to up their game!

Grab your guitar and play a tasty groove.
What else? and that succession be determined. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;' Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.' And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. I never long'd to hear a word till now; Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: The word is short, but not so short as sweet; No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse, I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night, For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
You Manc so-and-so!
Toodaloo ! See you after the wedding!
That guy got hit full on.
That jerk was a mouth breather.
I blame not her, she could say little less; She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen? For I have heard that she was there in place. 'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done, And I am ready to put armour on.'

He rivered an ace to make a full house.
Fuck da pope!
My underwear was in the wash, so I had to free-ball it.

Think not the king did banish thee, But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit, Where it perceives it is but faintly borne. Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour And not the king exiled thee; or suppose Devouring pestilence hangs in our air And thou art flying to a fresher clime: Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
Can I get my fade dude?
the nuptial finish'd, Let him be whipt and hang'd. I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your highness said even now, I made you a duke: good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

You are très bizzare!
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: I have more care to stay than will to go: Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
The bouncers busted on some drunk guy last night.
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him? Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them Even to their ships.

The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes; for by such was it acted. till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,' I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed colour;
Oh, go fug yourself.
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland, But none returns. For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossible. Besides, our nearness to the king in love Is near the hate of those love not the king.
This is a srs problem.
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee. In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment, Which being shallow, you give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf; And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
If you cross me, it'll be the last thing you do.
I got so shit-canned last night, I was throwing up everywhere.
We were doing a hundred down the road.
The jacks pulled me over for no reason.
Be calm, be calm. It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot, To curb the will of the nobility: Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled.

Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's; For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help, And we shall have more wars before 't be long. As Henry's late presaging prophecy Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond, So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
I need to piss like a race horse.
The hogs got my brother for robbery.

I'll chill wit' cha later.
That's one mean bum-chin!
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd With the attainder of his slanderous lips.

That girl is a beezy.
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face Until my husband bid me. What, are you married?
It's cold as hell in here.
I like GUIs because I can grep them visually for what I'm looking for.
I got this slick app for my phone.
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear. Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of; For I have often heard my mother say I came into the world with my legs forward: Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste, And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right? The midwife wonder'd and the women cried 'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!' And so I was;
He is such a skeeve.
Person A: You are ugly. Person B: sfw.

I'm hungry, let's go strap on a feedbag.
I'm going to haze him about that girl he hooked up with last night.
He forced it, giving me detention for not doing my homework!
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day. Brother, we done deeds of charity; Made peace enmity, fair love of hate, Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers. A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege: Amongst this princely heap, if any here, By false intelligence, or wrong surmise, Hold me a foe;

My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-- I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state; as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel;
 I shall obey him.
See that po over there? Go through that side street to get around him. It's sketchy , but better than being thrown in the drunk tank.
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, And hath bereft thee of thy life too late! Woe above woe! grief more than common grief! O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
calling death banishment, Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
I was doing cartwheels after she said she'd go to prom with me.
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby. Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart: Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way; What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind, For the instalment of this noble duke In the seat royal of this famous isle?

Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din? Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air: Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, Only to stick it in their children's sight For terror, not to use, in time the rod Becomes more mock'd than fear'd;
As I guess, Marcius, Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates, Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius, Their very heart of hope. I do beseech you, By all the battles wherein we have fought, By the blood we have shed together, by the vows We have made to endure friends, that you directly Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore three-pile; but now I am out of service: But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines by night: And when I wander here and there, I then do most go right.

Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot? Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?

I don't consider myself no pimp, more of a... male madam.
Who can be patient in such extremes? Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid And never seen thee, never borne thee son, Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Our natures do pursue, Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment.
I knew you B4 we went to the same school together.

Within whose circuit is Elysium And all that poets feign of bliss and joy. Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest Until the white rose that I wear be dyed Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart. Richard, enough; I will be king, or die. Brother, thou shalt to London presently, And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
Thank y'all awesome.

Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house, That nothing sung but death to us and ours: Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound, And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak. I think his understanding is bereft. Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee? Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

You know I got me a needle.

That's somewhat madly spoken. Pardon it; The phrase is to the matter.
Up in the cuts.
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work: You peers, continue this united league: I every day expect an embassage From my Redeemer to redeem me hence; And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven, Since I have set my friends at peace on earth. Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand; Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
Hey jabronie ! You shut your mouth.
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure of; and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have. This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

He's always peacing early.
I sometime lay here in Corioli At a poor man's house; he used me kindly: He cried to me; I saw him prisoner; But then Aufidius was within my view, And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you To give my poor host freedom.
Ay! Youse blokes don't go the knuckle in 'ere - you'll get chucked out.
I am so deaded , I can't go out tonight.

Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father's wreck, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air:

You're a garden-variety person.
To disproportion me in every part, Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp That carries no impression like the dam. And am I then a man to be beloved? O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought! And yet I know not how to get the crown, For many lives stand between me and home:

Well the mob loved me cuz I was a great earner and I use to give 'em scads of dough.

He's always blowing his own trumpet.
How! away! Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs Are servanted to others: though I owe My revenge properly, my remission lies In Volscian breasts.
Don't crack on him because he's gay.
That's the way; for women are light at midnight. Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me; I am his brother, and I love him well. If you be hired for meed, go back again, And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find: and all this is long of you.

Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.

To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or, If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward, Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining From course required; or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust And therein negligent; or else a fool That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn, And takest it all for jest.

To fight on Edward's party for the crown; And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up. I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's; Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine I am too childish-foolish for this world.
Dude robbed her last night, he was the victor . or He vic'd her ass.
Their transformations Were never for a piece of beauty rarer, Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts Burn hotter than my faith. O, but, sir, Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
Ay, Edward will use women honourably. Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, To cross me from the golden time I look for! A cold premeditation for my purpose! Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty; So do I wish the crown, being so far off; And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
Being a scutt, he intentionally tried to hurt her.

Go to kennel, Pompey; go. What news, friar, of the duke? I know none. Can you tell me of any?
In one little body Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind; For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, Without a sudden calm, will overset Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife! Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
Holla at your boy.

And what hear there for welcome but my groans? Therefore commend me; let him not come there, To seek out sorrow that dwells every where. Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:

For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey, And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire, The mere effusion of thy proper loins, Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, For ending thee no sooner.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York. What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death? Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad; And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus. Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport: York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
That's one mother of a computer!
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly;

Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show; which, God he knows, Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.

Hath she had any more than one husband? Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
Alack, why am I sent for to a king, Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs: Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me To this submission. Yet I well remember The favours of these men: were they not mine? Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me? So Judas did to Christ:
That was bull-babbage.
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
That guy was talking trash . I'm going to have to lay the smack down on him.
That's a SpottieOttieDope.
Pass me the doja.
That car looks really chapped.
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards As victors wear at the Olympian games: This may plant courage in their quailing breasts; For yet is hope of life and victory. Forslow no longer, make we hence amain. 3 KING HENRY VI
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,-- Nay, and you shall hear some. Will you be gone? 
That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood: But you are more inhuman, more inexorable, O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania. See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears: This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, And I with tears do wash the blood away. Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
He drank a hella-liter of Coke.
Most willingly; But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it. He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow. Worthy Cominius, speak. Nay, keep your place.
So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.
Hey man , we going to Arizona tonight?
I'm all about indie right now. Screw pop.
I'm not flush , but I do try to treat myself once and a while.
Why do you all refuse to allow others to be themselves? Why not live and let live? SMH.
I really think you're capable of moving into front-end development. But to do well in interviews, you need to know how to speak the language.
Well, here he comes. Calmly, I do beseech you.
Where did you hark that couch?
You look like a rubby!
The guy's a complete dipshit.
Be ruled by him. Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side, I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic That's bitter to sweet end.
You need to get the fuck out of here before I get mad.
Person A: The earth is only 6000 years old. Person B: derp.
Person A: I got an F on my Research paper. Person B: Well, you used poor sources. Garbage in, garbage out.
 
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up the shore! but that's not the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a cork into a hogshead.
An if he may, then am I lawful king; For Richard, in the view of many lords, Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, Whose heir my father was, and I am his. He rose against him, being his sovereign, And made him to resign his crown perforce.
She's really pms -ing today.

That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps? If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it: I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
The shop teacher is a real hard-ass.
He's got the hots for his psych prof.
That, if you fail in our request, the blame May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
We got a schload of it.
She gave him a snowball.

Chris level is the most talked about person in the world on Google and yahoo.
You are a pair of strange ones. Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
He scared the bejibbers out of me!
Dude , that is slag.
That fool ain't no gangster.
I'm not interested in that naff stuff.
They ranked him out and beat him up.
To me comes a creature, Sometimes her head on one side, some another; I never saw a vessel of like sorrow, So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes, Like very sanctity, she did approach My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me, And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes Became two spouts:
Look at her huge snorbs
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more, But that I seek occasion how to rise, And yet the king not privy to my drift, Nor any of the house of Lancaster? But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
That pussy is so rachet and stanky. Her legs is like Taylor Swift's song: they are never getting back together.
Drift Hunters.
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd: I do repent me; read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand. It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down. I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king; Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
I had to deep six my girlfriend, she was an ass.
It's a good thing I had my brain bucket on!
That bitch ratchet cuz!
Man I'm fucking wired.
Go thou away: I'll follow instantly. I am glad at heart To be so rid o' the business.
Sweating very badly.
Oh coolio!
None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it: novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure;
When she told me how old she was, I damn near put down some brown!
True, my good lord; I know you for no less. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom, As being well content with that alone.
I love our team, but our quarterback is a douche bag.
which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious;
We should really surface the 'turn off all email notices' setting in the user profile.

The girls at the party heard how big my domepiece was.
Yo , come here.
Anywho ... I'm going to head home now.
That's you with that shotcallin' click huh?
You rabbit , i don't wanna play with you.
He is such a pud.
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard The traitor speak, and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treason; That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens, who haply may Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
Why did you kick his ass? gp.
Okay... got my camera foked on her, damn she's hot.
She is definitely feedbag material!

Fark Off.
I heard so-and-so has the High Five.
You're 29 years old, Robbie? Shut up ! You don't look a day older than 23!
I've got some. True do!
Person 2: Dang ! She is swerve!
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair, And this is he was his adopted heir. But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath? As I bethink me, you should not be king Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
Did you see that shot? That was elite!
True killing machine.
O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O that you could! What then, sir?
Tell him, when that our princely father York Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm, And charged us from his soul to love each other, He little thought of this divided friendship: Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
He hooked me up with some dinner.
O, forfend it, God, That in a Christian climate souls refined Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed! I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks, Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king: My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king, Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king: And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
Don't forget to bring me back a sambo!
Her eye discourses; I will answer it. I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
Abhorred slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes With words that made them known.
As many as you please. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
Crank up the radio. This song is awesome.
There's no way we can hang out with that taco tonight!
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown. Your worship is deceived; the gown is made Just as my master had direction: Grumio gave order how it should be done.
She turned up the heat in her marriage with some new lingerie.
for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly, The selfsame sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage but Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone? I told you what would come of this: beseech you, Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,-- Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther, But milk my ewes and weep.
God and our innocency defend and guard us! Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
Trick don't kill my high.
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves And hung their rotten coffins up in chains, It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart. The sight of any of the house of York Is as a fury to torment my soul; And till I root out their accursed line And leave not one alive, I live in hell. Therefore--
Hey dawg just notty yo hair.
Carnally, she says. Sirrah, no more!
What are you doing in there? Choking the chicken?
I do beseech you, By all the battles wherein we have fought, By the blood we have shed together, by the vows We have made to endure friends, that you directly Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates; And that you not delay the present, but, Filling the air with swords advanced and darts, We prove this very hour.
You stupid kike.
Not so: I am as ignorant in that as you In so entitling me, and no less honest Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant, As this world goes, to pass for honest. Traitors! Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard. Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard; Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
You should show him respect or he may put you on his Fan List.
Hey spider , why don't you go get the drinks?
I'm a graduate of the school of hard knocks.
You're such a scrote.
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense. What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
Boy: Why did you break up with me? Girl: You pretty much played my face.. why would we still go out?
O this woodcock, what an ass it is! Peace, sirrah!
Hey look! Rich got his Old Betsy started.
Good my liege, I come; And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess Myself your loyal servant, your physician, Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare Less appear so in comforting your evils, Than such as most seem yours:
My lord, most villanously; believe it. Well, he in time may come to clear himself; But at this instant he is sick my lord, Of a strange fever.
and we here deliver, Subscribed by the consuls and patricians, Together with the seal o' the senate, what We have compounded on. Read it not, noble lords; But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree He hath abused your powers.

So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo? The miserable have no other medicine But only hope: I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
Man, to pass this test, I'm gunna have ta flex my dolex.

That party last night was so beast in a can!
He needs to take a chill pill.
He's to make his requests by particulars; wherein every one of us has a single honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how you shall go by him.
That movie was butt.
They've got a pretty sweet BOGO deal on tablets right now.
Dude , I gotta hit the bathroom, I'm totally sharpening a pencil.
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord? To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded. They, for their truth, might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats. But come, my lord, let us away.
I triple dog dare you to jump off the roof into the pool.
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
You really chowed down at that buffet tonight.
That fence post is on the piss.
I have orders up the ying-yang to pack and ship today.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandon'd from your bed. 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone. Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported? She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself, fellow Curtis.
Person A: I can't believe it man, I puked on her at the club and she still came home with me. Person B: Wow, you totally paulbagged that one.
You got an F on that stupid test, man you're a dick wad.
Sir, my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she cannot come. How! she is busy and she cannot come! Is that an answer?
Come on bruh , you know that ain't right.

I haven't read that book since Hector was a pup.
If I catch you in my room, you're gonna enter a world of hurt.
Turn on the radio, we need some tune-age.
I'm sick of my boss's constant shit talking.
Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new-beloved any where: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Make way, unruly woman! After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse; Spur post, and get before him to the king, And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee. I'll not be long behind;
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking: the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully:
Well RIP that guy I guess.
Alright, who's baking brownies?
He played like a squid.
Yo let me get a swig of that Alize.
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king. He is both king and Duke of Lancaster; And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
and, but he's something stain'd With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em. I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
That chick's got some nasty hail damage!
I caught her cheating and She said whatever.
Damn, that girl's got some tig ol' bitties!
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to-- Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
We pray with heart and soul and all beside: His weary joints would gladly rise, I know; Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow: His prayers are full of false hypocrisy; Ours of true zeal and deep integrity. Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
From Facebook (August 22, 2020): Digital blackface not only is about whites posting GIFs of blacks but it's also when white people use POC skins in video games. If you are white playing with a black or brown skin, then this is digital blackface.
which if you seek to prove, I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon His execution sworn. I do believe thee: I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand: Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago.
How much would it cost to get that what-cha-ma-call-it you said would fix my computer?
I got beef with you.
For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in parliament Touching King Henry's oath and your succession. Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
Hey, them shoes go!
Hey, do you have any more Zannies?
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. Is it good den?
She spent the day at that shi-shi spa.
Um, a-wad.
My website got Slashdotted yesterday.
What, like a corse? No, like a bank for love to lie and play on; Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried, But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:

Ned got strunk.
Who's that jamokie?
You speak too bitterly. Hear me a word; For I shall never speak to thee again.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were! She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
This particle board furniture is weak sauce.
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale? Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
She may help you to many fair preferments, And then deny her aiding hand therein, And lay those honours on your high deserts. What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she-- What, marry, may she?
And they had happy happy.
If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it? The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
I saw it in the theaters four times. I think I might be an Avatard.
Am I like such a fellow? Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty, By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie. Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage, Disclaiming here the kindred of the king, And lay aside my high blood's royalty, Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
Person 1: Like 80% of all of the people in the world are like 10 feet tall. Person 2: You better fact check yourself.
Person 1: Man, that girl is a boss, she really knows what she wants! Person 2: Well yeah! That girl's a kaylee!
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste: Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius. To speak so indirectly I am loath: I would say the truth; but to accuse him so, That is your part: yet I am advised to do it; He says, to veil full purpose.
He's such a schlep.
Dang , you see that broad 's outfit? She look trifling!
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink. Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir. Signior Baptista, you are happily met. Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of: I pray you stand good father to me now, Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
Daddy let a stinker.
That girl is quite an item . Good find, man.
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this. 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone: And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Look, as I blow this feather from my face, And as the air blows it to me again, Obeying with my wind when I do blow, And yielding to another when it blows, Commanded always by the greater gust; Such is the lightness of you common men. But do not break your oaths; for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty. Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
That concert was wicked!
You gonna spark that j or what, doobie master?
We all got torn down when he showed up with the keg.
He went to jail because he is a skinner.

I can't meet you right now. There are some cling-ons who have been here since noon.
but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin. You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord, Too ceremonious and traditional Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
Why'd you let him bag on you like that?
I like that - that's a goodie , John.

Did you get some play last night?
Thou wilt amend thy life? Ay, an it like your good worship.
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home, he had lived. Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
It took a lot of hard work and a very strict diet for me to get my body sliced.
I'm just a JAFO.
When your mom finds out, she's going to shit a brick.
But he, poor soul, by your first order died, And that a winged Mercury did bear: Some tardy cripple bore the countermand, That came too lag to see him buried. God grant that some, less noble and less loyal, Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood, Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, And yet go current from suspicion!
You're very welcome. I should leave grazing, were I of your flock, And only live by gazing.
One on 's father's moods. Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
Your daughter's a real smarty . She must have gotten that from your wife's side of the family.
That has a bomb diggity rack.
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,-- With best advantage will deceive the time, And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms: But on thy side I may not be too forward Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, Be executed in his father's sight. Farewell:
What then! He'ld make an end of thy posterity. Bastards and all. Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much; I do lament the sickness of the king. As loath to lose him, not your father's death; It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost. Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead. The king my uncle is to blame for this: God will revenge it; whom I will importune With daily prayers all to that effect.
I love you bubbie.
I gotta go pinch a grogan.
Man you torched the bowl, fucked the taste up.
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine Were not revenge sufficient for me; No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves And hung their rotten coffins up in chains, It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
I'm going to get some z's . Could you turn down the TV?
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child. Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.
We were freakin' all night.
I don't hang with jits.
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery: but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
He took it right in the chops . Look at those chops.
Faith, there had been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground:
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet; Put up your swords. My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage, Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice That he is thus cut off.
Sir, believe this, I had rather give my body than my soul. I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins Stand more for number than for accompt.
I need a slash.
He is such a mule head.
for, brother, if thou didst, Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak. Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last; And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.

You're such a retard.
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. Yes, better, sir.
It doesn't make any sense for Jack and I to give each other gas money for the daily commute to work. As long as we take turns driving every few days it's a wash and it works out fine.
Stay, Edward. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay: These words will cost ten thousand lives this day. 3 KING HENRY VI
If thou wouldst, There shouldst thou find one heinous article, Containing the deposing of a king And cracking the strong warrant of an oath, Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven: Nay, all of you that stand and look upon, Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself, Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands Showing an outward pity;

Any fellow Pakis on this forum?
Do you want to smoke?
The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father: The which will I; not all so much for love As for another secret close intent, By marrying her which I must reach unto. But yet I run before my horse to market: Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
With an eye of green in't. He misses not much.
My son is so slow in the morning, he puttses around the house.

Of that fatal country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented.

My clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse;

Truly, the souls of men are full of dread: Ye cannot reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and full of fear.

or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust And therein negligent; or else a fool That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn, And takest it all for jest.

Yo, man, you see Eazy earlin' in tha parking lot?
Will you just look at these mooks?
If you are willing to give yur lady the attention she desires, jerk the johnson before hand.
Farewell. I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a more comfortable sort:
Take off , I ain't got all day!
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet, 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more. The gods assist you!
You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves. Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo.
That skyscraper is the most ginormous skyscraper I have ever seen!
My favorite bar is kind of a hole.
My wallet got clipped at that bar.
Bill, I want to be the Ass Leaper of this arguement.
Shut up , knob gobbler.
You'll think it strange if I should marry her. To whom, my lord?
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds: Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd; And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach. Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault? I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
That was cool , eh?
Those Norwegians he was playing were rubbish.
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
Why, uncle, what's the matter? O my liege, Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased Not to be pardon'd, am content withal. Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Here, most gracious liege. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
Sir, his stoutness When he did stand for consul, which he lost By lack of stooping,-- That I would have spoke of: Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth; Presented to my knife his throat: I took him; Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way In all his own desires;
George is jonesin' for Stephanie!
I really need some pooty tang.
therefore follow me, and I direct you how you shall go by him. Content, content.
This beer is shwag.
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman cardinally given, might have been accused in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there. By the woman's means?
tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion. Hold thy desperate hand: Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast: Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death, Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment, Could all but answer for that peevish brat? Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses! If not by war, by surfeit die your king, As ours by murder, to make him a king!
This child was prisoner to the womb and is By law and process of great nature thence Freed and enfranchised, not a party to The anger of the king nor guilty of, If any be, the trespass of the queen. I do believe it.
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points? When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim: Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest, As from my death-bed, thy last living leave. In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid;
I, for one being a everyday Facebooker, was unaware that i was already at the 5000 friends limit and was put in Facebook Jail for 1 week and 3 days. I couldn't access any of my add a friend features. I heard some people had to recreate passwords and everything.
Speaker: You got some beer? Response: And a half!
Alas, alas! Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once; And He that might the vantage best have took Found out the remedy. How would you be, If He, which is the top of judgment, should But judge you as you are? O, think on that; And mercy then will breathe within your lips, Like man new made.
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, While I make way from hence to save my life: You understand me? I, sir! ne'er a whit.
He got caught stealing a car. They gonna lock him up in the pokey.
I said I couldn't go out, so he cracked the sads.
Let's go to Yolanda's tilt.
I don't go to Club Cocobongo, that place is suspect.
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies, Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies: Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath, The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. 
This white sauce is suspy.
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence? Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Death is a fearful thing. And shamed life a hateful.
Say, has our general met the enemy? They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
For a successful party, one must have the proper roast-beef-to-sausage ratio.
Person A: <makes joke> Person B: lmro!
Masters of the people, Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- That's thousand to one good one--when you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
My insurance rates are pretty high. I called the Insurance Board to see if the company is meeting all state guidelines, but basically at this point I'm just grasping at straws.
Once I get my business off the ground , I'll think about buying a house.
Did you see Jim in the club? He was murkin' out.
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said Which was sometime his general; who loved him In a most dear particular. He call'd me father: But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him; A mile before his tent fall down, and knee The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
Girlie is bomb diggity.
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas; The duke is made protector of the realm; And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds The trembling lamb environed with wolves. Had I been there, which am a silly woman, The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes Before I would have granted to that act. But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back? Where are thy tenants and thy followers? Are they not now upon the western shore. Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships! No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently. Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain The execution of my big-swoln heart Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer. I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
seize it, if thou darest. An if I do not, may my hands rot off And never brandish more revengeful steel Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy? Go sleep, and hear us.
Do you like or like like her?
If she dares trust me with her little babe, I'll show't the king and undertake to be Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know How he may soften at the sight o' the child: The silence often of pure innocence Persuades when speaking fails.
That car cut us off , so I had to swerve.
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star; But none can cure their harms by wailing them. Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee I crave your blessing.
Why don't you just piss off?
Not letting the deceased rest in peace [ FOH ],
Let go of my hand - I give.
She just bought a bean from the DJ.
I shall inform them. And when such time they have begun to cry, Let them not cease, but with a din confused Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentence.
Look at Michael he just dropped like 10 hits of liquid LSD, he's stuck on perma- grin. That shit must be super good. I want some.

Get away from me, you brain-damaged cunt.
I really gotta jam.

in that day's feats, When he might act the woman in the scene, He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea, And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland.
What is this fuckery?
They fear us not, but issue forth their city. Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus: They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows: He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce, And he shall feel mine edge.
Yeah, don't worry about Megan; I flicked her.
I need to clean your tushy before I put on the diaper.
What's up Young'n.

I popped open a cold one put my feet up and am going to straight up fux.

What's the action?
He looks like he has one foot in the grave.
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke After the prompter, for our entrance: But let them measure us by what they will; We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling; Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree; All several sins, all used in each degree, Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty! I shall despair. There is no creature loves me; And if I die, no soul shall pity me: Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself Find in myself no pity to myself?
After hauling furniture up three flights of stairs all day, he crashed and burned, and slept for 16 hours straight.
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow Set down our host. My partner in this action, You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly I have borne this business. Only their ends You have respected; stopp'd your ears against The general suit of Rome; never admitted A private whisper, no, not with such friends That thought them sure of you.
My husband bids me; now I will unmask. This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on; This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body That took away the match from Isabel, And did supply thee at thy garden-house In her imagined person.
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not fitted for 't. O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night, and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the sounder all the next day.
Out, alas! You'd be so lean, that blasts of January Would blow you through and through. Now, my fair'st friend, I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might Become your time of day; and yours, and yours, That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina, For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall From Dis's waggon!
Man, she skitsed out on me at work.
All those ding-heads are causing trouble around this neighborhood.
That's so blown.
I was scoping out that hot soccer player after practice.
Stop ragging on me!
He is a fatso.
 Righteous!
Person A: Want something to eat? Person B: Na.
There were mad chicks at the party!
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother. Better it were they all came by the father, Or by the father there were none at all; For emulation now, who shall be nearest, Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
And be thy wife--if any be so mad-- As miserable by the life of thee As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death! For never yet one hour in his bed Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep, But have been waked by his timorous dreams. Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
'I realized the Wisconsin Governor was a Yellowhammer when I saw the classic features of an inbred Baptist on his face...especially his half-closed eyelids.'
Up. Whither?
It's quitting time, guys. I'm out.
She's my pimpette , pays me in booze.
Shepherdess, A fair one are you--well you fit our ages With flowers of winter. of that kind Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not To get slips of them.
Have you been to our new hang?
Have you been smoking wacky tobaccy?
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Oh, poor Clarence! This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death? O, they did urge it still unto the king! God will revenge it.
Let's go play footy outside.
Well I'm late. I'm off like a prom dress in May.
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say: Your plainness and your shortness please me well. Right true it is, your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
Who's Baldy over there?
That is, were I under the terms of death, The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies, And strip myself to death, as to a bed That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield My body up to shame. Then must your brother die.
I am a feather for each wind that blows: Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father? better burn it now Than curse it then. But be it; let it live. It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
Dropping a bottle of beer on the patio is a serious party foul.
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
We have a gruntload of stuff to do here!
Your reason for being absent: your dog ate your wallet and you had no money to come to work? It's a real goodie.
'Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary, Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue; The crown will find an heir: great Alexander Left his to the worthiest; so his successor Was like to be the best.
He finally had enough roaches saved up to make a party-sized immigrant.

She's a total blow off ; she never goes to her classes!
My mother is my bubbie.
She's a floozy.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. What shall I swear by?
What did you do last night? I just stayed at home, downloaded some porn and knocked one out.
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe. By heaven, I think there's no man is secure But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
I'm coming to geit you.
I haven't had a five knuckle shuffle in a while.
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for disturbing the lords within. Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name? Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
Stop running your cum guzzler and talkin' shit.
I need to do homework this whole week, hum-bra , me too.
Marc is being a wass because he is whining again.
He's right stove up.
Ted Cruz is the retard poster boy.
Look at that fine cat across the street.
Our spoils he kick'd at, And look'd upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world: he covets less Than misery itself would give; rewards His deeds with doing them, and is content To spend the time to end it.
I cry thee mercy: There is my purse to cure that blow of thine. Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd Reward to him that brings the traitor in? Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
She scrambled my eggs when she kicked me in the crotch.
For she's a woman to be pitied much: Her sighs will make a battery in his breast; Her tears will pierce into a marble heart; The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn; And Nero will be tainted with remorse, To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears. Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
So they are; My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid:
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
You know they be dukin'.
Give me a magazine, I am going to go push brown.
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce. 
This is a poopy movie.
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no, I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world. That by degrees we mean to look into, And watch our vantage in this business: We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
How! no more! You speak o' the people, As if you were a god to punish, not A man of their infirmity.
I always look out for number one.
I care not: It is an heretic that makes the fire, Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant; But this most cruel usage of your queen, Not able to produce more accusation Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours Of tyranny and will ignoble make you, Yea, scandalous to the world.
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, With such austerity as 'longeth to a father. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy; 'Twere good he were school'd.
Are these your herd? Must these have voices, that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices? You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth? Have you not set them on?
I found some pretty good dinner ideas on the interwebs.
After I get off work, I'm going to my girlfriend's house, and we'll probably be waxing ass.
He had to go so bad, he was dottin' cotton.
He wants me to come over and dust his action figures, or some shit.
Are you going to the spring formal?
Not a hair perish'd; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. The king's son have I landed by himself; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.
in that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; And what these sorrows could not thence exhale, Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping. I never sued to friend nor enemy; My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; But now thy beauty is proposed my fee, My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Shit , I'm dolo right now...
if one jot beyond The bound of honour, or in act or will That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin Cry fie upon my grave! I ne'er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first.
You have got to be jiving me.

Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears; And now, to add more measure to your woes, I come to tell you things sith then befall'n. After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
You on that fuck boy hoe ass shit!
O just but severe law! I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour! 
OK boys, in case you haven't heard the rules, the Big Kahuna (a trophy bull elk) is for me.
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art up-roused by some distemperature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right, Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a creeping thing. He loved his mother dearly.
OMG that movie was freaky ! I was scared shitless.
I brodied his jacket after he told me I couldn't have it.
You're moving to a small town in Alabama? That's practically Deliveranceville!

I can't believe that old man goosed me.
He's totally ninja.
Look at the crazy pants running around topless.
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave, Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant. My lord,--
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow: So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you; For, I am sure, you have your hands full all, In this so sudden business.
 WOYM?
Have you told your parents you're TTC?
That was quite a French kiss.
He is so loaded right now!
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow. Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking: the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation.
He is being such a prick!
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of my Romeo's name. It is my soul that calls upon my name: How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York. Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so; Though this be all, do not so quickly go; I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what? -- With all good speed at Plashy visit me. Alack, and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls, Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
Do you have any snaps for gas.

Your mom tweaked when I snaked her last bagel.

I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place;
One-time lit us up, dog.
I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father's ground. Now Jove afford you cause! To me the difference forges dread; your greatness Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble To think your father, by some accident, Should pass this way as you did:
That weirdo is one fry shy of a happy meal.

Good beer, innit?
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
I shall, sir. Fare you well. Good night. This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid! And by an eminent body that enforced The law against it!

Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep, Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy To kings that fear their subjects' treachery? O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth. And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds, His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury When Oxford had me down, he rescued me, And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'? Who told me, when we both lay in the field Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me Even in his own garments, and gave himself, All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
Quarrel sir! no, sir. If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
My dad Sprang into action.
Julia fucked my best friend, his cousin, and most of the school. She's a thot.
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together. And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes. Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, How doth the prince, and my young son of York? Right well, dear madam. By your patience, I may not suffer you to visit them; The king hath straitly charged the contrary.

Bound by my charity and my blest order, I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison. Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes, that I may minister To them accordingly.
The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham. For what offence?
and when with grief he wept, The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain: And after many scorns, many foul taunts, They took his head, and on the gates of York They set the same; and there it doth remain, The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth? Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath; For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
I'm all out of cream.
Could you be a bigger fuck-stick?
Mondays are such a bitch.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, In the preferment of the eldest sister. This liberty is all that I request, That, upon knowledge of my parentage, I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo And free access and favour as the rest:

You really are a turkey.
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads, For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son. Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham, Then cursed she Richard.

My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou bid'st us. That Shall be when your first queen's again in breath; Never till then.
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar: Far be it from my heart, the thought of it! As little joy, my lord, as you suppose You should enjoy, were you this country's king, As little joy may you suppose in me. That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
My pony tail needs a binder.
Yo , he gots on some punk panties.
Naw , you ain't finna do me.
Now, as fond fathers, Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, Only to stick it in their children's sight For terror, not to use, in time the rod Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; And liberty plucks justice by the nose; The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart Goes all decorum.
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it. Would you enforce me to a world of care? Well, call them again. I am not made of stone, But penetrable to your. kind entreats, Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd And slept above some fifteen year or more. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.

My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour Than at the strangeness of it. Come hither, Isabel. Your friar is now your prince: as I was then Advertising and holy to your business, Not changing heart with habit, I am still Attorney'd at your service.
Yo , hook a niggah up with a cigarette.
If I don't get some face tonight I'll explode.

Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne, Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?

Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight, Or like an idle thresher with a flail, Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.

Is that your crew?
Quit being a corth.
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

The evening cab dispatcher for Checkered Cab is a real ass-wipe.
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace; Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway, When they are bound to serve, love and obey. Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts?
I love me an out of shape man with some nice dangle flap.

We are not, sir, nor are we like to be; The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first: The odds for high and low's alike. My lord, Is this the daughter of a king?
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle; Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield. Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, Where having nothing, nothing can he lose. And as for you yourself, our quondam queen, You have a father able to maintain you;
Seven year and a half, sir. I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
Then is he more beholding to you than I. He may command me as my sovereign; But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
That Shall be when your first queen's again in breath; Never till then. One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access To your high presence.

Do I speak feelingly now? I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.
I never long'd to hear a word till now; Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: The word is short, but not so short as sweet; No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet. Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth: A dearer merit, not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air, Have I deserved at your highness' hands. The language I have learn'd these forty years, My native English, now I must forego:
