Write a sentence Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
Write a sentence Well, well, we'll leave you.
Write a sentence Why stay we to be baited
Write a sentence Take my prayers with you.
Write a sentence You have told them home;

Write a sentence Fie, fie, fie!
Write a sentence I know you well, sir, and you know
Write a sentence It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
Write a sentence I am a Roman; and my services are,
Write a sentence Nicanor? no.
Write a sentence The same, sir.
Write a sentence You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
Write a sentence There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
Write a sentence Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
Write a sentence The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
Write a sentence Coriolanus banished!
Write a sentence Banished, sir.
Write a sentence You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
Write a sentence The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
Write a sentence He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus

Write a sentence You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
Write a sentence Well, let us go together.
Write a sentence A goodly city is this Antium. City,
Write a sentence And you.
Write a sentence Direct me, if it be your will,
Write a sentence He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
Write a sentence Which is his house, beseech you?
Write a sentence This, here before you.
Write a sentence Thank you, sir: farewell.
Write a sentence Wine, wine, wine! What service

Write a sentence Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
Write a sentence Away!
Write a sentence Away! get you away.

Write a sentence A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
Write a sentence What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
Write a sentence Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
Write a sentence What are you?
Write a sentence A gentleman.
Write a sentence A marvellous poor one.
Write a sentence True, so I am.
Write a sentence Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
Write a sentence Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
Write a sentence What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
Write a sentence And I shall.
Write a sentence Where dwellest thou?
Write a sentence Under the canopy.
Write a sentence Under the canopy!
Write a sentence Ay.
Write a sentence Where's that?
Write a sentence I' the city of kites and crows.
Write a sentence I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Write a sentence No, I serve not thy master.
Write a sentence How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
Write a sentence Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
Write a sentence Where is this fellow?
Write a sentence Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
Write a sentence Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Write a sentence If, Tullus,
Write a sentence What is thy name?
Write a sentence A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
Write a sentence Say, what's thy name?
Write a sentence Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
Write a sentence I know thee not: thy name?
Write a sentence My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
Write a sentence O Marcius, Marcius!
Write a sentence You bless me, gods!
Write a sentence Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
Write a sentence Here's a strange alteration!
Write a sentence By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
Write a sentence What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
Write a sentence Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
Write a sentence He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
Write a sentence So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
Write a sentence I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
Write a sentence Who, my master?
Write a sentence Nay, it's no matter for that.
Write a sentence Worth six on him.
Write a sentence Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
Write a sentence Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
Write a sentence Ay, and for an assault too.
Write a sentence O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
Write a sentence What, what, what? let's partake.
Write a sentence I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
Write a sentence Wherefore? wherefore?
Write a sentence Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Write a sentence Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
Write a sentence I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
Write a sentence Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
Write a sentence He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
Write a sentence An he had been cannibally given, he might have
Write a sentence But, more of thy news?
Write a sentence Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
Write a sentence And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
Write a sentence Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
Write a sentence Directitude! what's that?
Write a sentence But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
Write a sentence But when goes this forward?
Write a sentence To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
Write a sentence Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
Write a sentence Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
Write a sentence 'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
Write a sentence Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
Write a sentence Reason; because they then less need one another.
Write a sentence In, in, in, in!
Write a sentence We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
Write a sentence We stood to't in good time.
Write a sentence 'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
Write a sentence Hail sir!
Write a sentence Hail to you both!
Write a sentence Your Coriolanus
Write a sentence All's well; and might have been much better, if
Write a sentence Where is he, hear you?
Write a sentence Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Write a sentence The gods preserve you both!
Write a sentence God-den, our neighbours.
Write a sentence God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
Write a sentence Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
Write a sentence Live, and thrive!
Write a sentence Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Write a sentence Now the gods keep you!
Write a sentence Farewell, farewell.
Write a sentence This is a happier and more comely time
Write a sentence Caius Marcius was
Write a sentence And affecting one sole throne,
Write a sentence I think not so.
Write a sentence We should by this, to all our lamentation,
Write a sentence The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Write a sentence Worthy tribunes,
Write a sentence 'Tis Aufidius,
Write a sentence Come, what talk you
Write a sentence Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
Write a sentence Cannot be!
Write a sentence Tell not me:
Write a sentence Not possible.
Write a sentence The nobles in great earnestness are going
Write a sentence 'Tis this slave;--
Write a sentence Yes, worthy sir,
Write a sentence What more fearful?
Write a sentence It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
Write a sentence This is most likely!
Write a sentence Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Write a sentence The very trick on't.
Write a sentence This is unlikely:
Write a sentence You are sent for to the senate:
Write a sentence O, you have made good work!
Write a sentence What news? what news?
Write a sentence You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
Write a sentence What's the news? what's the news?
Write a sentence Your temples burned in their cement, and
Write a sentence Pray now, your news?
Write a sentence If!
Write a sentence You have made good work,
Write a sentence He will shake
Write a sentence As Hercules
Write a sentence But is this true, sir?
Write a sentence Ay; and you'll look pale
Write a sentence We are all undone, unless
Write a sentence Who shall ask it?
Write a sentence 'Tis true:
Write a sentence You have brought
Write a sentence Say not we brought it.
Write a sentence How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
Write a sentence But I fear
Write a sentence Here come the clusters.
Write a sentence Faith, we hear fearful news.
Write a sentence For mine own part,
Write a sentence And so did I.
Write a sentence And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
Write a sentence Ye re goodly things, you voices!
Write a sentence You have made
Write a sentence O, ay, what else?
Write a sentence Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
Write a sentence The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
Write a sentence So did we all. But, come, let's home.
Write a sentence I do not like this news.
Write a sentence Nor I.
Write a sentence Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Write a sentence Pray, let us go.
Write a sentence Do they still fly to the Roman?
Write a sentence I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Write a sentence I cannot help it now,
Write a sentence Yet I wish, sir,--
Write a sentence I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
Write a sentence Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
Write a sentence All places yield to him ere he sits down;
Write a sentence No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
Write a sentence He would not seem to know me.
Write a sentence Do you hear?
Write a sentence Yet one time he did call me by my name:
Write a sentence Why, so: you have made good work!
Write a sentence I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
Write a sentence Very well:
Write a sentence I offer'd to awaken his regard
Write a sentence For one poor grain or two!
Write a sentence Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
Write a sentence No, I'll not meddle.
Write a sentence Pray you, go to him.
Write a sentence What should I do?
Write a sentence Only make trial what your love can do
Write a sentence Well, and say that Marcius
Write a sentence Yet your good will
Write a sentence I'll undertake 't:
Write a sentence You know the very road into his kindness,
Write a sentence Good faith, I'll prove him,
Write a sentence He'll never hear him.
Write a sentence Not?
Write a sentence I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Write a sentence Stay: whence are you?
Write a sentence Stand, and go back.
Write a sentence You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
Write a sentence From whence?
Write a sentence From Rome.
Write a sentence You may not pass, you must return: our general
Write a sentence You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
Write a sentence Good my friends,
Write a sentence Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Write a sentence I tell thee, fellow,
Write a sentence Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
Write a sentence Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
Write a sentence Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
Write a sentence Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
Write a sentence You are a Roman, are you?
Write a sentence I am, as thy general is.
Write a sentence Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
Write a sentence Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
Write a sentence Come, my captain knows you not.
Write a sentence I mean, thy general.
Write a sentence My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
Write a sentence Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
Write a sentence What's the matter?
Write a sentence Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
Write a sentence Away!
Write a sentence How! away!
Write a sentence Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Write a sentence You keep a constant temper.
Write a sentence Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
Write a sentence 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
Write a sentence Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
Write a sentence What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
Write a sentence I neither care for the world nor your general: for
Write a sentence A noble fellow, I warrant him.
Write a sentence The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
Write a sentence We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Write a sentence Only their ends
Write a sentence This last old man,
Write a sentence My lord and husband!
Write a sentence These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
Write a sentence The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Write a sentence Like a dull actor now,
Write a sentence O, stand up blest!
Write a sentence What is this?
Write a sentence Thou art my warrior;
Write a sentence The noble sister of Publicola,
Write a sentence This is a poor epitome of yours,
Write a sentence The god of soldiers,
Write a sentence Your knee, sirrah.
Write a sentence That's my brave boy!
Write a sentence Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Write a sentence I beseech you, peace:
Write a sentence O, no more, no more!
Write a sentence Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Write a sentence Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
Write a sentence Ay, and mine,
Write a sentence A' shall not tread on me;
Write a sentence Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Write a sentence Nay, go not from us thus.
Write a sentence O mother, mother!
Write a sentence I was moved withal.
Write a sentence I dare be sworn you were:
Write a sentence Ay, by and by;
Write a sentence See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
Write a sentence Why, what of that?
Write a sentence If it be possible for you to displace it with your
Write a sentence Is't possible that so short a time can alter the

Write a sentence So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
Write a sentence Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
Write a sentence I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
Write a sentence The gods be good unto us!
Write a sentence No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
Write a sentence Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
Write a sentence What's the news?
Write a sentence Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
Write a sentence Friend,
Write a sentence As certain as I know the sun is fire:
Write a sentence This is good news:
Write a sentence First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Write a sentence Sir, we have all
Write a sentence They are near the city?
Write a sentence Almost at point to enter.
Write a sentence We will meet them,
Write a sentence Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Write a sentence Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
Write a sentence Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Write a sentence How is it with our general?
Write a sentence Even so
Write a sentence Most noble sir,
Write a sentence Sir, I cannot tell:
Write a sentence The people will remain uncertain whilst
Write a sentence I know it;
Write a sentence Sir, his stoutness
Write a sentence That I would have spoke of:
Write a sentence So he did, my lord:
Write a sentence There was it:
Write a sentence Your native town you enter'd like a post,
Write a sentence And patient fools,
Write a sentence Therefore, at your vantage,
Write a sentence Say no more:
Write a sentence You are most welcome home.
Write a sentence I have not deserved it.
Write a sentence We have.
Write a sentence And grieve to hear't.
Write a sentence He approaches: you shall hear him.
Write a sentence Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
Write a sentence Read it not, noble lords;
Write a sentence Traitor! how now!
Write a sentence Ay, traitor, Marcius!
Write a sentence Marcius!
Write a sentence Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
Write a sentence Hear'st thou, Mars?
Write a sentence Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
Write a sentence Ha!
Write a sentence No more.
Write a sentence Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Write a sentence Peace, both, and hear me speak.
Write a sentence Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Write a sentence Why, noble lords,
Write a sentence Let him die for't.
Write a sentence 'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
Write a sentence Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
Write a sentence O that I had him,
Write a sentence Insolent villain!
Write a sentence Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
Write a sentence Hold, hold, hold, hold!
Write a sentence My noble masters, hear me speak.
Write a sentence O Tullus,--
Write a sentence Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
Write a sentence Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Write a sentence My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Write a sentence Bear from hence his body;
Write a sentence His own impatience
Write a sentence My rage is gone;
Write a sentence Now is the winter of our discontent
Write a sentence His majesty
Write a sentence Upon what cause?
Write a sentence Because my name is George.
Write a sentence Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
Write a sentence Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
Write a sentence Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
Write a sentence By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
Write a sentence Humbly complaining to her deity
Write a sentence I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
Write a sentence Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
Write a sentence With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
Write a sentence Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
Write a sentence What one, my lord?
Write a sentence Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
Write a sentence I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Write a sentence We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
Write a sentence We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Write a sentence I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Write a sentence Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Write a sentence I must perforce. Farewell.
Write a sentence Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Write a sentence Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
Write a sentence As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Write a sentence With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
Write a sentence No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
Write a sentence More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
Write a sentence What news abroad?
Write a sentence No news so bad abroad as this at home;
Write a sentence Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
Write a sentence He is.
Write a sentence Go you before, and I will follow you.
Write a sentence Set down, set down your honourable load,
Write a sentence Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
Write a sentence What black magician conjures up this fiend,
Write a sentence Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
Write a sentence My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
Write a sentence Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Write a sentence What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Write a sentence Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
Write a sentence Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
Write a sentence Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Write a sentence Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
Write a sentence But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
Write a sentence O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
Write a sentence More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Write a sentence Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
Write a sentence Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Write a sentence Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
Write a sentence By such despair, I should accuse myself.
Write a sentence And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
Write a sentence Say that I slew them not?
Write a sentence Why, then they are not dead:
Write a sentence I did not kill your husband.
Write a sentence Why, then he is alive.
Write a sentence Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
Write a sentence In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Write a sentence I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
Write a sentence Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Write a sentence I grant ye.
Write a sentence Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Write a sentence The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
Write a sentence He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
Write a sentence Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
Write a sentence And thou unfit for any place but hell.
Write a sentence Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
Write a sentence Some dungeon.
Write a sentence Your bed-chamber.
Write a sentence I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
Write a sentence So will it, madam till I lie with you.
Write a sentence I hope so.
Write a sentence I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
Write a sentence Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
Write a sentence Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Write a sentence If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
Write a sentence These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
Write a sentence Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
Write a sentence Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
Write a sentence I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
Write a sentence It is a quarrel most unnatural,
Write a sentence It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
Write a sentence He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Write a sentence His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
Write a sentence He lives that loves thee better than he could.
Write a sentence Name him.
Write a sentence Plantagenet.
Write a sentence Why, that was he.
Write a sentence The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
Write a sentence Where is he?
Write a sentence Here.
Write a sentence Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
Write a sentence Never came poison from so sweet a place.
Write a sentence Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Write a sentence Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
Write a sentence Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
Write a sentence I would they were, that I might die at once;
Write a sentence Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
Write a sentence Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
Write a sentence I have already.
Write a sentence Tush, that was in thy rage:
Write a sentence I would I knew thy heart.
Write a sentence 'Tis figured in my tongue.
Write a sentence I fear me both are false.
Write a sentence Then never man was true.
Write a sentence Well, well, put up your sword.
Write a sentence Say, then, my peace is made.
Write a sentence That shall you know hereafter.
Write a sentence But shall I live in hope?
Write a sentence All men, I hope, live so.
Write a sentence Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
Write a sentence To take is not to give.
Write a sentence Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Write a sentence What is it?
Write a sentence That it would please thee leave these sad designs
Write a sentence With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
Write a sentence Bid me farewell.
Write a sentence 'Tis more than you deserve;
Write a sentence Sirs, take up the corse.
Write a sentence Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
Write a sentence No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
Write a sentence Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Write a sentence In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
Write a sentence If he were dead, what would betide of me?
Write a sentence No other harm but loss of such a lord.
Write a sentence The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
Write a sentence The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
Write a sentence Oh, he is young and his minority
Write a sentence Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
Write a sentence It is determined, not concluded yet:
Write a sentence Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
Write a sentence Good time of day unto your royal grace!
Write a sentence God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
Write a sentence The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
Write a sentence I do beseech you, either not believe
Write a sentence Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
Write a sentence But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Write a sentence What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
Write a sentence Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
Write a sentence God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
Write a sentence Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Write a sentence Would all were well! but that will never be
Write a sentence They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Write a sentence To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
Write a sentence To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
Write a sentence Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
Write a sentence I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
Write a sentence Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Write a sentence Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Write a sentence By Him that raised me to this careful height
Write a sentence You may deny that you were not the cause
Write a sentence She may, my lord, for--
Write a sentence She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
Write a sentence What, marry, may she?
Write a sentence What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
Write a sentence My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Write a sentence And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Write a sentence What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Write a sentence Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Write a sentence Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
Write a sentence Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
Write a sentence In all which time you and your husband Grey
Write a sentence A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
Write a sentence Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Write a sentence Which God revenge!
Write a sentence To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
Write a sentence Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Write a sentence My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Write a sentence If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Write a sentence As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
Write a sentence A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
Write a sentence Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
Write a sentence But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
Write a sentence Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
Write a sentence I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Write a sentence The curse my noble father laid on thee,
Write a sentence So just is God, to right the innocent.
Write a sentence O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
Write a sentence Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
Write a sentence No man but prophesied revenge for it.
Write a sentence Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
Write a sentence What were you snarling all before I came,
Write a sentence Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
Write a sentence And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
Write a sentence Margaret.
Write a sentence Richard!
Write a sentence Ha!
Write a sentence I call thee not.
Write a sentence I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
Write a sentence Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
Write a sentence 'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
Write a sentence Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
Write a sentence Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Write a sentence False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Write a sentence Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
Write a sentence Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
Write a sentence To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Write a sentence Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
Write a sentence Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Write a sentence Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
Write a sentence It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
Write a sentence Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Write a sentence And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Write a sentence Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
Write a sentence Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Write a sentence Have done, have done.
Write a sentence O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
Write a sentence Nor no one here; for curses never pass
Write a sentence I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
Write a sentence What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
Write a sentence Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
Write a sentence What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
Write a sentence My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
Write a sentence And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
Write a sentence I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
Write a sentence I never did her any, to my knowledge.
Write a sentence But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
Write a sentence A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
Write a sentence So do I ever:
Write a sentence Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
Write a sentence Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
Write a sentence Madam, we will attend your grace.
Write a sentence I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
Write a sentence We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
Write a sentence Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
Write a sentence Tush!
Write a sentence Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
Write a sentence We will, my noble lord.
Write a sentence Why looks your grace so heavily today?
Write a sentence O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
Write a sentence What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
Write a sentence Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
Write a sentence Had you such leisure in the time of death
Write a sentence Methought I had; and often did I strive
Write a sentence Awaked you not with this sore agony?
Write a sentence O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
Write a sentence No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
Write a sentence O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Write a sentence I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Write a sentence Ho! who's here?
Write a sentence In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
Write a sentence I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
Write a sentence Yea, are you so brief?
Write a sentence O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
Write a sentence I am, in this, commanded to deliver
Write a sentence Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
Write a sentence What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
Write a sentence No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Write a sentence When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
Write a sentence Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
Write a sentence The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
Write a sentence What, art thou afraid?
Write a sentence Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
Write a sentence I thought thou hadst been resolute.
Write a sentence So I am, to let him live.
Write a sentence Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
Write a sentence I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
Write a sentence How dost thou feel thyself now?
Write a sentence 'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
Write a sentence Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
Write a sentence 'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
Write a sentence Where is thy conscience now?
Write a sentence In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
Write a sentence So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
Write a sentence Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
Write a sentence How if it come to thee again?
Write a sentence I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
Write a sentence 'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
Write a sentence Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
Write a sentence Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
Write a sentence Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
Write a sentence Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
Write a sentence O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
Write a sentence Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
Write a sentence No, first let's reason with him.
Write a sentence Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
Write a sentence You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
Write a sentence In God's name, what art thou?
Write a sentence A man, as you are.
Write a sentence But not, as I am, royal.
Write a sentence Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Write a sentence Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
Write a sentence My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
Write a sentence How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Write a sentence To, to, to--
Write a sentence To murder me?
Write a sentence Ay, ay.
Write a sentence You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
Write a sentence Offended us you have not, but the king.
Write a sentence I shall be reconciled to him again.
Write a sentence Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
Write a sentence Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
Write a sentence What we will do, we do upon command.
Write a sentence And he that hath commanded is the king.
Write a sentence Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Write a sentence And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
Write a sentence And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Write a sentence Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
Write a sentence How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
Write a sentence Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
Write a sentence Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
Write a sentence My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
Write a sentence Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Write a sentence Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
Write a sentence You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
Write a sentence O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Write a sentence Ay, so we will.
Write a sentence Tell him, when that our princely father York
Write a sentence Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
Write a sentence O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
Write a sentence Right,
Write a sentence It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
Write a sentence Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
Write a sentence Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
Write a sentence Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
Write a sentence What shall we do?
Write a sentence Relent, and save your souls.
Write a sentence Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
Write a sentence Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Write a sentence Look behind you, my lord.
Write a sentence Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
Write a sentence A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
Write a sentence How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
Write a sentence I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Write a sentence So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Write a sentence Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
Write a sentence By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
Write a sentence So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
Write a sentence Take heed you dally not before your king;
Write a sentence So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
Write a sentence And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
Write a sentence Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Write a sentence Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Write a sentence Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
Write a sentence This interchange of love, I here protest,
Write a sentence And so swear I, my lord
Write a sentence Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
Write a sentence Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
Write a sentence A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
Write a sentence And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
Write a sentence Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
Write a sentence Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Write a sentence A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
Write a sentence A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
Write a sentence Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
Write a sentence Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
Write a sentence All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
Write a sentence Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
Write a sentence Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
Write a sentence Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
Write a sentence But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
Write a sentence A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
Write a sentence I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
Write a sentence I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
Write a sentence Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
Write a sentence The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Write a sentence Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
Write a sentence This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
Write a sentence We wait upon your grace.
Write a sentence Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
Write a sentence No, boy.
Write a sentence Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
Write a sentence Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
Write a sentence My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
Write a sentence Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
Write a sentence And so will I.
Write a sentence Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Write a sentence Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Write a sentence Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
Write a sentence Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
Write a sentence Ay, boy.
Write a sentence I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
Write a sentence Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
Write a sentence What means this scene of rude impatience?
Write a sentence To make an act of tragic violence:
Write a sentence Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
Write a sentence Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
Write a sentence Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Write a sentence Give me no help in lamentation;
Write a sentence Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
Write a sentence Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
Write a sentence What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
Write a sentence What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
Write a sentence What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
Write a sentence Was never widow had so dear a loss!
Write a sentence Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
Write a sentence Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Write a sentence Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
Write a sentence Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Write a sentence Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
Write a sentence God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Write a sentence You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
Write a sentence Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
Write a sentence Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
Write a sentence I hope the king made peace with all of us
Write a sentence And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Write a sentence And so say I.
Write a sentence Then be it so; and go we to determine
Write a sentence With all our harts.
Write a sentence My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
Write a sentence My other self, my counsel's consistory,
Write a sentence Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
Write a sentence I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Write a sentence Ay, that the king is dead.
Write a sentence Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
Write a sentence Neighbours, God speed!
Write a sentence Give you good morrow, sir.
Write a sentence Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
Write a sentence Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
Write a sentence Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
Write a sentence No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
Write a sentence Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
Write a sentence In him there is a hope of government,
Write a sentence So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Write a sentence Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
Write a sentence Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
Write a sentence Better it were they all came by the father,
Write a sentence Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
Write a sentence When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
Write a sentence Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Write a sentence Before the times of change, still is it so:
Write a sentence Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
Write a sentence And so was I: I'll bear you company.
Write a sentence Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
Write a sentence I long with all my heart to see the prince:
Write a sentence But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Write a sentence Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
Write a sentence Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
Write a sentence Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
Write a sentence Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
Write a sentence Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
Write a sentence I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
Write a sentence Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
Write a sentence How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
Write a sentence Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
Write a sentence I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
Write a sentence Grandam, his nurse.
Write a sentence His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
Write a sentence If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
Write a sentence A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
Write a sentence Good madam, be not angry with the child.
Write a sentence Pitchers have ears.
Write a sentence Here comes a messenger. What news?
Write a sentence Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
Write a sentence How fares the prince?
Write a sentence Well, madam, and in health.
Write a sentence What is thy news then?
Write a sentence Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
Write a sentence Who hath committed them?
Write a sentence The mighty dukes
Write a sentence For what offence?
Write a sentence The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Write a sentence Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
Write a sentence Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
Write a sentence Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Write a sentence I'll go along with you.
Write a sentence You have no cause.
Write a sentence My gracious lady, go;
Write a sentence Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
Write a sentence Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
Write a sentence No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Write a sentence Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Write a sentence God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
Write a sentence My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
Write a sentence God bless your grace with health and happy days!
Write a sentence I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
Write a sentence And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
Write a sentence Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
Write a sentence On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
Write a sentence Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Write a sentence My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Write a sentence You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Write a sentence My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Write a sentence I go, my lord.
Write a sentence Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Write a sentence Where it seems best unto your royal self.
Write a sentence I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Write a sentence He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Write a sentence Is it upon record, or else reported
Write a sentence Upon record, my gracious lord.
Write a sentence But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Write a sentence What say you, uncle?
Write a sentence I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Write a sentence That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
Write a sentence What, my gracious lord?
Write a sentence An if I live until I be a man,
Write a sentence Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
Write a sentence Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
Write a sentence Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
Write a sentence Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Write a sentence How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
Write a sentence I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
Write a sentence He hath, my lord.
Write a sentence And therefore is he idle?
Write a sentence O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
Write a sentence Then is he more beholding to you than I.
Write a sentence He may command me as my sovereign;
Write a sentence I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
Write a sentence My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
Write a sentence A beggar, brother?
Write a sentence Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
Write a sentence A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
Write a sentence A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
Write a sentence A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
Write a sentence O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
Write a sentence It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
Write a sentence I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
Write a sentence What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
Write a sentence I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
Write a sentence How?
Write a sentence Little.
Write a sentence My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Write a sentence You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Write a sentence With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
Write a sentence My lord, will't please you pass along?
Write a sentence What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
Write a sentence My lord protector needs will have it so.
Write a sentence I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
Write a sentence Why, what should you fear?
Write a sentence Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
Write a sentence I fear no uncles dead.
Write a sentence Nor none that live, I hope.
Write a sentence An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
Write a sentence Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Write a sentence No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Write a sentence Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
Write a sentence He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
Write a sentence What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
Write a sentence He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
Write a sentence Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
Write a sentence Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
Write a sentence Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
Write a sentence My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
Write a sentence Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
Write a sentence You shall, my lord.
Write a sentence At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
Write a sentence Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Write a sentence Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
Write a sentence I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
Write a sentence And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Write a sentence What, ho! my lord!
Write a sentence A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
Write a sentence What is't o'clock?
Write a sentence Upon the stroke of four.
Write a sentence Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
Write a sentence So it should seem by that I have to say.
Write a sentence And then?
Write a sentence And then he sends you word
Write a sentence Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
Write a sentence My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
Write a sentence Many good morrows to my noble lord!
Write a sentence Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
Write a sentence It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
Write a sentence How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
Write a sentence Ay, my good lord.
Write a sentence I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Write a sentence Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
Write a sentence Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Write a sentence God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
Write a sentence But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
Write a sentence What, my lord?
Write a sentence Ere a fortnight make me elder,
Write a sentence 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
Write a sentence O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
Write a sentence The princes both make high account of you;
Write a sentence I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
Write a sentence My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
Write a sentence My lord,
Write a sentence The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Write a sentence Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
Write a sentence They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
Write a sentence Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
Write a sentence The better that your lordship please to ask.
Write a sentence I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
Write a sentence God hold it, to your honour's good content!
Write a sentence Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
Write a sentence God save your lordship!
Write a sentence Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
Write a sentence I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
Write a sentence What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Write a sentence Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
Write a sentence I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
Write a sentence 'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
Write a sentence I'll wait upon your lordship.
Write a sentence Come, bring forth the prisoners.
Write a sentence Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
Write a sentence God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
Write a sentence You live that shall cry woe for this after.
Write a sentence Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
Write a sentence O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Write a sentence Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
Write a sentence Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Write a sentence Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
Write a sentence Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
Write a sentence My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Write a sentence Are all things fitting for that royal time?
Write a sentence It is, and wants but nomination.
Write a sentence To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
Write a sentence Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Write a sentence Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
Write a sentence Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
Write a sentence I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
Write a sentence Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
Write a sentence My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
Write a sentence Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
Write a sentence Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
Write a sentence I thank your grace.
Write a sentence My lord of Ely!
Write a sentence My lord?
Write a sentence When I was last in Holborn,
Write a sentence Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
Write a sentence Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Write a sentence Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
Write a sentence We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
Write a sentence Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
Write a sentence His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
Write a sentence What of his heart perceive you in his face
Write a sentence Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
Write a sentence I pray God he be not, I say.
Write a sentence I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
Write a sentence The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Write a sentence Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
Write a sentence If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
Write a sentence If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
Write a sentence Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
Write a sentence Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Write a sentence O momentary grace of mortal men,
Write a sentence Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
Write a sentence O bloody Richard! miserable England!
Write a sentence Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Write a sentence Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Write a sentence He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
Write a sentence Lord mayor,--
Write a sentence Look to the drawbridge there!
Write a sentence Hark! a drum.
Write a sentence Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
Write a sentence Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
Write a sentence Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
Write a sentence God and our innocency defend and guard us!
Write a sentence Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
Write a sentence Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
Write a sentence So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
Write a sentence Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
Write a sentence What, had he so?
Write a sentence What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Write a sentence Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
Write a sentence Yet had not we determined he should die,
Write a sentence But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
Write a sentence And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
Write a sentence But since you come too late of our intents,
Write a sentence Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
Write a sentence Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
Write a sentence If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
Write a sentence I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Write a sentence Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Write a sentence This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;

Write a sentence Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
Write a sentence Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

Write a sentence Nay, nothing; all is said
Write a sentence Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Write a sentence The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
Write a sentence How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
Write a sentence Why, uncle, what's the matter?
Write a sentence O my liege,
Write a sentence Think what you will, we seize into our hands
Write a sentence I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
Write a sentence Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
Write a sentence Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
Write a sentence And living too; for now his son is duke.
Write a sentence Barely in title, not in revenue.
Write a sentence Richly in both, if justice had her right.
Write a sentence My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
Write a sentence Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
Write a sentence Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
Write a sentence No good at all that I can do for him;
Write a sentence Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
Write a sentence The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
Write a sentence And daily new exactions are devised,
Write a sentence Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
Write a sentence The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
Write a sentence The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.
Write a sentence Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
Write a sentence He hath not money for these Irish wars,
Write a sentence His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
Write a sentence We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
Write a sentence Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
Write a sentence Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
Write a sentence Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
Write a sentence Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
Write a sentence To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
Write a sentence Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
Write a sentence Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
Write a sentence To please the king I did; to please myself
Write a sentence Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Write a sentence It may be so; but yet my inward soul
Write a sentence 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
Write a sentence 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
Write a sentence God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
Write a sentence Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
Write a sentence That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
Write a sentence Now God in heaven forbid!
Write a sentence Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
Write a sentence Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
Write a sentence We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Write a sentence So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
Write a sentence Despair not, madam.
Write a sentence Who shall hinder me?
Write a sentence Here comes the Duke of York.
Write a sentence With signs of war about his aged neck:
Write a sentence Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
Write a sentence My lord, your son was gone before I came.
Write a sentence He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
Write a sentence My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
Write a sentence What is't, knave?
Write a sentence An hour before I came, the duchess died.
Write a sentence God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Write a sentence The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
Write a sentence Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Write a sentence And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Write a sentence Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
Write a sentence If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
Write a sentence Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
Write a sentence Thither will I with you; for little office
Write a sentence No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Write a sentence That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
Write a sentence Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Write a sentence Well, we may meet again.
Write a sentence I fear me, never.
Write a sentence How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
Write a sentence Believe me, noble lord,
Write a sentence Of much less value is my company
Write a sentence It is my son, young Harry Percy,
Write a sentence I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
Write a sentence Why, is he not with the queen?
Write a sentence No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
Write a sentence What was his reason?
Write a sentence Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
Write a sentence Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
Write a sentence No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
Write a sentence Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
Write a sentence My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
Write a sentence I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
Write a sentence How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
Write a sentence There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
Write a sentence Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Write a sentence Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
Write a sentence Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
Write a sentence And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
Write a sentence Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Write a sentence It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
Write a sentence My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
Write a sentence My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
Write a sentence Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
Write a sentence I shall not need transport my words by you;
Write a sentence Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
Write a sentence My gracious uncle--
Write a sentence Tut, tut!
Write a sentence My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
Write a sentence Even in condition of the worst degree,
Write a sentence As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
Write a sentence The noble duke hath been too much abused.
Write a sentence It stands your grace upon to do him right.
Write a sentence Base men by his endowments are made great.
Write a sentence My lords of England, let me tell you this:
Write a sentence The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
Write a sentence Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
Write a sentence An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
Write a sentence It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
Write a sentence My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
Write a sentence Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
Write a sentence 'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
Write a sentence Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
Write a sentence Bring forth these men.
Write a sentence More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Write a sentence My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
Write a sentence My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Write a sentence A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
Write a sentence Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
Write a sentence Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
Write a sentence Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
Write a sentence Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
Write a sentence Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
Write a sentence He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
Write a sentence Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
Write a sentence Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Write a sentence Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
Write a sentence But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Write a sentence Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
Write a sentence I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Write a sentence More health and happiness betide my liege
Write a sentence Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
Write a sentence Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
Write a sentence Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Write a sentence Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
Write a sentence O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Write a sentence Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Write a sentence Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
Write a sentence Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
Write a sentence Where is the duke my father with his power?
Write a sentence No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
Write a sentence My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
Write a sentence My father hath a power; inquire of him
Write a sentence Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
Write a sentence Men judge by the complexion of the sky
Write a sentence Thou hast said enough.
Write a sentence My liege, one word.
Write a sentence He does me double wrong
Write a sentence So that by this intelligence we learn
Write a sentence The news is very fair and good, my lord:
Write a sentence It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
Write a sentence Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Write a sentence The time hath been,
Write a sentence Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
Write a sentence Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Write a sentence I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Write a sentence The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
Write a sentence Royally!
Write a sentence Yes, my good lord,
Write a sentence O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
Write a sentence Noble lords,
Write a sentence Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
Write a sentence We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
Write a sentence The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
Write a sentence Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
Write a sentence No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Write a sentence O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
Write a sentence Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
Write a sentence What must the king do now? must he submit?
Write a sentence My lord, in the base court he doth attend
Write a sentence Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Write a sentence What says his majesty?
Write a sentence Sorrow and grief of heart
Write a sentence Stand all apart,
Write a sentence Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
Write a sentence My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
Write a sentence Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
Write a sentence So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
Write a sentence Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
Write a sentence Yea, my good lord.
Write a sentence Then I must not say no.
Write a sentence What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
Write a sentence Madam, we'll play at bowls.
Write a sentence 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
Write a sentence Madam, we'll dance.
Write a sentence My legs can keep no measure in delight,
Write a sentence Madam, we'll tell tales.
Write a sentence Of sorrow or of joy?
Write a sentence Of either, madam.
Write a sentence Of neither, girl:
Write a sentence Madam, I'll sing.
Write a sentence 'Tis well that thou hast cause
Write a sentence I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
Write a sentence And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
Write a sentence Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Write a sentence Why should we in the compass of a pale
Write a sentence Hold thy peace:
Write a sentence What, are they dead?
Write a sentence They are; and Bolingbroke
Write a sentence What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
Write a sentence Depress'd he is already, and deposed
Write a sentence O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
Write a sentence Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
Write a sentence Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Write a sentence Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
Write a sentence Call forth Bagot.
Write a sentence Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
Write a sentence Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
Write a sentence My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Write a sentence Princes and noble lords,
Write a sentence Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
Write a sentence Excepting one, I would he were the best
Write a sentence If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
Write a sentence Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
Write a sentence Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
Write a sentence Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
Write a sentence Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
Write a sentence An if I do not, may my hands rot off
Write a sentence I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
Write a sentence Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
Write a sentence My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
Write a sentence 'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
Write a sentence As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
Write a sentence Surrey, thou liest.
Write a sentence Dishonourable boy!
Write a sentence How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
Write a sentence Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
Write a sentence These differences shall all rest under gage
Write a sentence That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Write a sentence Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
Write a sentence As surely as I live, my lord.
Write a sentence Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Write a sentence Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
Write a sentence In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
Write a sentence Marry. God forbid!
Write a sentence Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Write a sentence Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
Write a sentence I will be his conduct.
Write a sentence Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Write a sentence Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Write a sentence To do that office of thine own good will
Write a sentence Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
Write a sentence I thought you had been willing to resign.
Write a sentence My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
Write a sentence Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
Write a sentence Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
Write a sentence Are you contented to resign the crown?
Write a sentence Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
Write a sentence No more, but that you read
Write a sentence Must I do so? and must I ravel out
Write a sentence My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
Write a sentence Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
Write a sentence My lord,--
Write a sentence No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
Write a sentence Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
Write a sentence Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
Write a sentence Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
Write a sentence Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
Write a sentence The commons will not then be satisfied.
Write a sentence They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
Write a sentence The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
Write a sentence Say that again.
Write a sentence Name it, fair cousin.
Write a sentence 'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
Write a sentence Yet ask.
Write a sentence And shall I have?
Write a sentence You shall.
Write a sentence Then give me leave to go.
Write a sentence Whither?
Write a sentence Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
Write a sentence Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
Write a sentence O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
Write a sentence On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Write a sentence A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
Write a sentence The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Write a sentence You holy clergymen, is there no plot
Write a sentence My lord,
Write a sentence This way the king will come; this is the way
Write a sentence Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
Write a sentence What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
Write a sentence A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
Write a sentence My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
Write a sentence Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
Write a sentence My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
Write a sentence Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
Write a sentence And must we be divided? must we part?
Write a sentence Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
Write a sentence Banish us both and send the king with me.
Write a sentence That were some love but little policy.
Write a sentence Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
Write a sentence So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Write a sentence So longest way shall have the longest moans.
Write a sentence Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
Write a sentence Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
Write a sentence We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
Write a sentence My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
Write a sentence Where did I leave?
Write a sentence At that sad stop, my lord,
Write a sentence Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Write a sentence Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
Write a sentence As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
Write a sentence Here comes my son Aumerle.
Write a sentence Aumerle that was;
Write a sentence Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
Write a sentence Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
Write a sentence Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Write a sentence For aught I know, my lord, they do.
Write a sentence You will be there, I know.
Write a sentence If God prevent not, I purpose so.
Write a sentence What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Write a sentence My lord, 'tis nothing.
Write a sentence No matter, then, who see it;
Write a sentence I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
Write a sentence Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
Write a sentence What should you fear?
Write a sentence Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
Write a sentence I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
Write a sentence I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Write a sentence What is the matter, my lord?
Write a sentence Ho! who is within there?
Write a sentence Why, what is it, my lord?
Write a sentence Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Write a sentence What is the matter?
Write a sentence Peace, foolish woman.
Write a sentence I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
Write a sentence Good mother, be content; it is no more
Write a sentence Thy life answer!
Write a sentence Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
Write a sentence Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Write a sentence Give me my boots, I say.

Write a sentence Thou fond mad woman,
Write a sentence He shall be none;
Write a sentence Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
Write a sentence Hadst thou groan'd for him
Write a sentence Make way, unruly woman!
Write a sentence After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Write a sentence Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
Write a sentence My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
Write a sentence And what said the gallant?
Write a sentence His answer was, he would unto the stews,
Write a sentence As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
Write a sentence Where is the king?
Write a sentence What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
Write a sentence God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
Write a sentence Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
Write a sentence For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
Write a sentence Intended or committed was this fault?
Write a sentence Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
Write a sentence Have thy desire.
Write a sentence Villain, I'll make thee safe.
Write a sentence Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
Write a sentence What is the matter, uncle? speak;
Write a sentence Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
Write a sentence Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
Write a sentence It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
Write a sentence O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
Write a sentence So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
Write a sentence What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
Write a sentence A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
Write a sentence Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
Write a sentence If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
Write a sentence O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
Write a sentence Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Write a sentence Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
Write a sentence Rise up, good aunt.
Write a sentence Not yet, I thee beseech:
Write a sentence Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
Write a sentence Against them both my true joints bended be.
Write a sentence Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
Write a sentence Good aunt, stand up.
Write a sentence Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'

Write a sentence Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Write a sentence Good aunt, stand up.
Write a sentence I do not sue to stand;
Write a sentence I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
Write a sentence O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Write a sentence With all my heart
Write a sentence A god on earth thou art.
Write a sentence But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,

Write a sentence Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
Write a sentence These were his very words.
Write a sentence 'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
Write a sentence He did.
Write a sentence And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
Write a sentence I have been studying how I may compare
Write a sentence Hail, royal prince!
Write a sentence Thanks, noble peer;

Write a sentence Help, help, help!
Write a sentence How now! what means death in this rude assault?
Write a sentence As full of valour as of royal blood:

Write a sentence My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Write a sentence I neither know it nor can learn of him.

Write a sentence Tush, I will stir about,
Write a sentence Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
Write a sentence What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
Write a sentence No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
Write a sentence Good night:
Write a sentence Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
Write a sentence Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
Write a sentence They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Write a sentence Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
Write a sentence Go, you cot-quean, go,
Write a sentence No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
Write a sentence Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
Write a sentence A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Write a sentence Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Write a sentence Make haste, make haste.
Write a sentence I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
Write a sentence Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Write a sentence Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Write a sentence What noise is here?
Write a sentence O lamentable day!
Write a sentence What is the matter?
Write a sentence Look, look! O heavy day!
Write a sentence O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Write a sentence For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
Write a sentence She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
Write a sentence Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Write a sentence Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Write a sentence O lamentable day!
Write a sentence O woful time!
Write a sentence Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Write a sentence Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Write a sentence Ready to go, but never to return.
Write a sentence Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
Write a sentence Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Write a sentence O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Write a sentence Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Write a sentence Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Write a sentence Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
Write a sentence All things that we ordained festival,
Write a sentence Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
Write a sentence Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
Write a sentence Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
Write a sentence Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Write a sentence Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
Write a sentence Why 'Heart's ease?'
Write a sentence O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
Write a sentence Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
Write a sentence You will not, then?
Write a sentence No.
Write a sentence I will then give it you soundly.
Write a sentence What will you give us?
Write a sentence No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
Write a sentence Then I will give you the serving-creature.
Write a sentence Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
Write a sentence An you re us and fa us, you note us.
Write a sentence Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
Write a sentence Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
Write a sentence Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
Write a sentence Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
Write a sentence I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
Write a sentence Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
Write a sentence Faith, I know not what to say.
Write a sentence O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
Write a sentence What a pestilent knave is this same!
Write a sentence Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
Write a sentence If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
Write a sentence Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Write a sentence Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Write a sentence I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Write a sentence Tush, thou art deceived:
Write a sentence No, my good lord.
Write a sentence No matter: get thee gone,
Write a sentence Who calls so loud?
Write a sentence Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Write a sentence Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Write a sentence Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
Write a sentence My poverty, but not my will, consents.
Write a sentence I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Write a sentence Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Write a sentence There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Write a sentence Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Write a sentence This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Write a sentence Going to find a bare-foot brother out
Write a sentence Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
Write a sentence I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Write a sentence Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
Write a sentence Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
Write a sentence Now must I to the monument alone;
Write a sentence Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Write a sentence Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
Write a sentence Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Write a sentence I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Write a sentence So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Write a sentence Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Write a sentence This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
Write a sentence I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Write a sentence I do defy thy conjurations,
Write a sentence Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
Write a sentence O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
Write a sentence O, I am slain!
Write a sentence In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Write a sentence Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Write a sentence Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Write a sentence Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
Write a sentence It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
Write a sentence Who is it?
Write a sentence Romeo.
Write a sentence How long hath he been there?
Write a sentence Full half an hour.
Write a sentence Go with me to the vault.
Write a sentence I dare not, sir
Write a sentence Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
Write a sentence As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
Write a sentence Romeo!
Write a sentence O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
Write a sentence I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Write a sentence Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Write a sentence Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
Write a sentence This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
Write a sentence The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Write a sentence Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
Write a sentence Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
Write a sentence Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
Write a sentence A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
Write a sentence What misadventure is so early up,
Write a sentence What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
Write a sentence The people in the street cry Romeo,
Write a sentence What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Write a sentence Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
Write a sentence Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
Write a sentence Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
Write a sentence O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
Write a sentence O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
Write a sentence Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
Write a sentence Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Write a sentence Look, and thou shalt see.
Write a sentence O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
Write a sentence Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Write a sentence I am the greatest, able to do least,
Write a sentence Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
Write a sentence I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Write a sentence We still have known thee for a holy man.
Write a sentence I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
Write a sentence Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Write a sentence He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
Write a sentence This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Write a sentence O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
Write a sentence But I can give thee more:
Write a sentence As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Write a sentence A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
Write a sentence I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
Write a sentence While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
Write a sentence Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Write a sentence And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Write a sentence Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
Write a sentence Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
Write a sentence Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
Write a sentence Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
Write a sentence And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Write a sentence Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
Write a sentence We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
Write a sentence Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
Write a sentence And when the king comes, offer no violence,
Write a sentence The queen this day here holds her parliament,
Write a sentence Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
Write a sentence The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
Write a sentence Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
Write a sentence Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
Write a sentence My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
Write a sentence If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
Write a sentence The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
Write a sentence What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
Write a sentence Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
Write a sentence Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
Write a sentence Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
Write a sentence Ah, know you not the city favours them,
Write a sentence But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
Write a sentence Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
Write a sentence I am thine.
Write a sentence For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
Write a sentence 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
Write a sentence Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
Write a sentence Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
Write a sentence Whom should he follow but his natural king?
Write a sentence True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
Write a sentence And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
Write a sentence It must and shall be so: content thyself.
Write a sentence Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
Write a sentence He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
Write a sentence And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
Write a sentence Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
Write a sentence Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Write a sentence Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
Write a sentence Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
Write a sentence Will you we show our title to the crown?
Write a sentence What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Write a sentence Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
Write a sentence The lord protector lost it, and not I:
Write a sentence You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Write a sentence Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
Write a sentence Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Write a sentence Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
Write a sentence Sons, peace!
Write a sentence Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
Write a sentence Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
Write a sentence Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Write a sentence Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
Write a sentence Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
Write a sentence 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
Write a sentence What then?
Write a sentence An if he may, then am I lawful king;
Write a sentence He rose against him, being his sovereign,
Write a sentence Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Write a sentence No; for he could not so resign his crown
Write a sentence Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
Write a sentence His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
Write a sentence Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
Write a sentence My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
Write a sentence Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Write a sentence Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
Write a sentence Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Write a sentence King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Write a sentence O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
Write a sentence Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
Write a sentence Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Write a sentence My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
Write a sentence Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
Write a sentence I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
Write a sentence What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
Write a sentence What good is this to England and himself!
Write a sentence Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
Write a sentence How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
Write a sentence I cannot stay to hear these articles.
Write a sentence Nor I.
Write a sentence Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
Write a sentence Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
Write a sentence Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
Write a sentence In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Write a sentence Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
Write a sentence They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
Write a sentence Ah, Exeter!
Write a sentence Why should you sigh, my lord?
Write a sentence Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Write a sentence This oath I willingly take and will perform.
Write a sentence Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
Write a sentence And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
Write a sentence Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
Write a sentence Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
Write a sentence Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
Write a sentence And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
Write a sentence And I to Norfolk with my followers.
Write a sentence And I unto the sea from whence I came.
Write a sentence And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
Write a sentence Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
Write a sentence Exeter, so will I.
Write a sentence Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
Write a sentence Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
Write a sentence Who can be patient in such extremes?
Write a sentence Father, you cannot disinherit me:
Write a sentence Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
Write a sentence Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
Write a sentence Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
Write a sentence Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
Write a sentence Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
Write a sentence Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
Write a sentence When I return with victory from the field
Write a sentence Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
Write a sentence Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Write a sentence And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
Write a sentence Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
Write a sentence No, I can better play the orator.
Write a sentence But I have reasons strong and forcible.
Write a sentence Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
Write a sentence No quarrel, but a slight contention.
Write a sentence About what?
Write a sentence About that which concerns your grace and us;
Write a sentence Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
Write a sentence Your right depends not on his life or death.
Write a sentence Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
Write a sentence I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
Write a sentence But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
Write a sentence No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
Write a sentence I shall be, if I claim by open war.
Write a sentence I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
Write a sentence Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
Write a sentence An oath is of no moment, being not took
Write a sentence Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
Write a sentence The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Write a sentence Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
Write a sentence Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
Write a sentence She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
Write a sentence What, with five thousand men?
Write a sentence Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
Write a sentence I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
Write a sentence Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
Write a sentence Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Write a sentence Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
Write a sentence And I, my lord, will bear him company.
Write a sentence Soldiers, away with him!
Write a sentence Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
Write a sentence How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
Write a sentence So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
Write a sentence In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
Write a sentence Then let my father's blood open it again:
Write a sentence Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Write a sentence O, let me pray before I take my death!
Write a sentence Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
Write a sentence I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
Write a sentence Thy father hath.
Write a sentence But 'twas ere I was born.
Write a sentence No cause!
Write a sentence Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
Write a sentence Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
Write a sentence The army of the queen hath got the field:
Write a sentence Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
Write a sentence Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
Write a sentence My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
Write a sentence So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
Write a sentence O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
Write a sentence I will not bandy with thee word for word,
Write a sentence Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
Write a sentence Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
Write a sentence Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
Write a sentence So doth the cony struggle in the net.
Write a sentence So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
Write a sentence What would your grace have done unto him now?
Write a sentence Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Write a sentence That is my office, for my father's sake.
Write a sentence Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
Write a sentence She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Write a sentence Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
Write a sentence That face of his the hungry cannibals
Write a sentence Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
Write a sentence What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Write a sentence Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
Write a sentence And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
Write a sentence Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
Write a sentence Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
Write a sentence I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Write a sentence I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Write a sentence Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
Write a sentence Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Write a sentence 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
Write a sentence Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
Write a sentence Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
Write a sentence O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
Write a sentence Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
Write a sentence Environed he was with many foes,
Write a sentence Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Write a sentence I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Write a sentence His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
Write a sentence Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Write a sentence How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
Write a sentence Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Write a sentence O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Write a sentence Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
Write a sentence Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
Write a sentence Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
Write a sentence 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Write a sentence Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
Write a sentence I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
Write a sentence Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
Write a sentence Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Write a sentence Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
Write a sentence No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
Write a sentence Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
Write a sentence Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
Write a sentence How now! what news?
Write a sentence The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
Write a sentence Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
Write a sentence Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Write a sentence Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
Write a sentence My gracious liege, this too much lenity
Write a sentence Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Write a sentence My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
Write a sentence Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
Write a sentence My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
Write a sentence Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
Write a sentence Royal commanders, be in readiness:
Write a sentence I would your highness would depart the field:
Write a sentence Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
Write a sentence Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
Write a sentence Be it with resolution then to fight.
Write a sentence My royal father, cheer these noble lords
Write a sentence Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
Write a sentence Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Write a sentence I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
Write a sentence And reason too:
Write a sentence Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
Write a sentence Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
Write a sentence 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
Write a sentence Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
Write a sentence For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
Write a sentence What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
Write a sentence Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
Write a sentence Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
Write a sentence You said so much before, and yet you fled.
Write a sentence 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
Write a sentence No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
Write a sentence Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Write a sentence I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
Write a sentence Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
Write a sentence Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
Write a sentence Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
Write a sentence I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
Write a sentence My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Write a sentence Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
Write a sentence Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
Write a sentence If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
Write a sentence If that be right which Warwick says is right,
Write a sentence Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
Write a sentence But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
Write a sentence Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Write a sentence A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
Write a sentence But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
Write a sentence And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Write a sentence Stay, Edward.
Write a sentence No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
Write a sentence Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
Write a sentence Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
Write a sentence How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
Write a sentence Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Write a sentence Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
Write a sentence Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Write a sentence Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
Write a sentence O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
Write a sentence Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Write a sentence Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.
Write a sentence Yet let us all together to our troops,
Write a sentence Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
Write a sentence Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
Write a sentence Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
Write a sentence This battle fares like to the morning's war,
Write a sentence Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
Write a sentence O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Write a sentence Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Write a sentence Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
Write a sentence How will my mother for a father's death
Write a sentence How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Write a sentence How will the country for these woful chances
Write a sentence Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Write a sentence Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
Write a sentence Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Write a sentence I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
Write a sentence These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
Write a sentence Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Write a sentence Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
Write a sentence Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Write a sentence Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Write a sentence Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
Write a sentence Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Write a sentence Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
Write a sentence No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
Write a sentence Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
Write a sentence A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
Write a sentence See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
Write a sentence Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Write a sentence From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Write a sentence Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
Write a sentence I think his understanding is bereft.
Write a sentence O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
Write a sentence If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
Write a sentence Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
Write a sentence Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
Write a sentence Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
Write a sentence While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
Write a sentence Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
Write a sentence Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
Write a sentence Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
Write a sentence They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
Write a sentence What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
Write a sentence Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
Write a sentence Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
Write a sentence Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
Write a sentence Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Write a sentence Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
Write a sentence I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
Write a sentence That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Write a sentence Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
Write a sentence From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
Write a sentence Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
Write a sentence Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
Write a sentence Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
Write a sentence Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
Write a sentence My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
Write a sentence Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
Write a sentence More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
Write a sentence Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
Write a sentence Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
Write a sentence But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
Write a sentence My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Write a sentence Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Write a sentence But did you never swear, and break an oath?
Write a sentence No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
Write a sentence Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Write a sentence Here in this country, where we now remain.
Write a sentence I was anointed king at nine months old;
Write a sentence No;
Write a sentence Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Write a sentence We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
Write a sentence So would you be again to Henry,
Write a sentence We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
Write a sentence In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
Write a sentence Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
Write a sentence Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
Write a sentence It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
Write a sentence Widow, we will consider of your suit;
Write a sentence Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
Write a sentence How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
Write a sentence Three, my most gracious lord.
Write a sentence 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
Write a sentence Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
Write a sentence Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
Write a sentence Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
Write a sentence Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
Write a sentence And would you not do much to do them good?
Write a sentence To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
Write a sentence Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
Write a sentence Therefore I came unto your majesty.
Write a sentence I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
Write a sentence So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
Write a sentence What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
Write a sentence What you command, that rests in me to do.
Write a sentence But you will take exceptions to my boon.
Write a sentence No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
Write a sentence Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
Write a sentence Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
Write a sentence Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
Write a sentence An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
Write a sentence That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
Write a sentence Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
Write a sentence I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
Write a sentence But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
Write a sentence The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
Write a sentence Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
Write a sentence My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
Write a sentence No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
Write a sentence Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
Write a sentence But now you partly may perceive my mind.
Write a sentence My mind will never grant what I perceive
Write a sentence To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
Write a sentence To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
Write a sentence Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
Write a sentence Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
Write a sentence Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
Write a sentence Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
Write a sentence Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
Write a sentence Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
Write a sentence 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
Write a sentence Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
Write a sentence And that is more than I will yield unto:
Write a sentence You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
Write a sentence 'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
Write a sentence No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Write a sentence Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
Write a sentence The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
Write a sentence You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
Write a sentence To whom, my lord?
Write a sentence Why, Clarence, to myself.
Write a sentence That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
Write a sentence That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
Write a sentence By so much is the wonder in extremes.
Write a sentence Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
Write a sentence My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
Write a sentence See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
Write a sentence Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Write a sentence Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Write a sentence No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
Write a sentence Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
Write a sentence From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
Write a sentence Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
Write a sentence Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
Write a sentence Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
Write a sentence The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
Write a sentence The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
Write a sentence O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
Write a sentence What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
Write a sentence Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
Write a sentence Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
Write a sentence Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
Write a sentence From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
Write a sentence King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Write a sentence Injurious Margaret!
Write a sentence And why not queen?
Write a sentence Because thy father Henry did usurp;
Write a sentence Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Write a sentence Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
Write a sentence Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Write a sentence Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Write a sentence Call him my king by whose injurious doom
Write a sentence And I the house of York.
Write a sentence Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Write a sentence Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
Write a sentence Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Write a sentence Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
Write a sentence But is he gracious in the people's eye?
Write a sentence The more that Henry was unfortunate.
Write a sentence Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Write a sentence Such it seems
Write a sentence Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
Write a sentence Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Write a sentence Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
Write a sentence To Edward, but not to the English king.
Write a sentence Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
Write a sentence And still is friend to him and Margaret:
Write a sentence Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Write a sentence Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Write a sentence Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
Write a sentence I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Write a sentence Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
Write a sentence Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
Write a sentence Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
Write a sentence Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
Write a sentence What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
Write a sentence I told your majesty as much before:
Write a sentence King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
Write a sentence Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
Write a sentence So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
Write a sentence Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
Write a sentence Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
Write a sentence My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
Write a sentence And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
Write a sentence And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Write a sentence Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
Write a sentence Then, England's messenger, return in post,
Write a sentence Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
Write a sentence Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
Write a sentence Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
Write a sentence But, Warwick,
Write a sentence This shall assure my constant loyalty,
Write a sentence Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Write a sentence Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
Write a sentence Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
Write a sentence I came from Edward as ambassador,
Write a sentence Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Write a sentence Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
Write a sentence My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
Write a sentence And his well-chosen bride.
Write a sentence I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
Write a sentence Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
Write a sentence As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Write a sentence Suppose they take offence without a cause,
Write a sentence And shall have your will, because our king:
Write a sentence Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
Write a sentence Not I:
Write a sentence Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Write a sentence Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Write a sentence And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
Write a sentence What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
Write a sentence Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
Write a sentence Why, knows not Montague that of itself
Write a sentence But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
Write a sentence 'Tis better using France than trusting France:
Write a sentence For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
Write a sentence Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
Write a sentence And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
Write a sentence Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Write a sentence Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
Write a sentence In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
Write a sentence Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
Write a sentence My lords, before it pleased his majesty
Write a sentence My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
Write a sentence Now, messenger, what letters or what news
Write a sentence My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
Write a sentence Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
Write a sentence At my depart, these were his very words:
Write a sentence Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
Write a sentence These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
Write a sentence I blame not her, she could say little less;
Write a sentence 'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
Write a sentence Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
Write a sentence He, more incensed against your majesty
Write a sentence Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Write a sentence Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
Write a sentence Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Write a sentence Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Write a sentence So God help Montague as he proves true!
Write a sentence And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
Write a sentence Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
Write a sentence Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
Write a sentence Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
Write a sentence Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
Write a sentence Fear not that, my lord.
Write a sentence Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
Write a sentence Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
Write a sentence What, will he not to bed?
Write a sentence Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
Write a sentence To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
Write a sentence But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
Write a sentence 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
Write a sentence O, is it so? But why commands the king
Write a sentence 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
Write a sentence Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
Write a sentence Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Write a sentence Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
Write a sentence This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
Write a sentence Who goes there?
Write a sentence Stay, or thou diest!
Write a sentence What are they that fly there?
Write a sentence Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
Write a sentence The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Write a sentence Ay, but the case is alter'd:
Write a sentence Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Write a sentence Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
Write a sentence What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
Write a sentence What now remains, my lords, for us to do
Write a sentence Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
Write a sentence Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
Write a sentence Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
Write a sentence What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
Write a sentence No, but the loss of his own royal person.
Write a sentence Then is my sovereign slain?
Write a sentence Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Write a sentence These news I must confess are full of grief;
Write a sentence Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
Write a sentence But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
Write a sentence I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
Write a sentence Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Write a sentence This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
Write a sentence Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Write a sentence Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Write a sentence But whither shall we then?
Write a sentence To Lynn, my lord,
Write a sentence Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
Write a sentence Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
Write a sentence But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
Write a sentence Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
Write a sentence Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
Write a sentence Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
Write a sentence Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
Write a sentence Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Write a sentence Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
Write a sentence For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Write a sentence Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
Write a sentence No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
Write a sentence And I choose Clarence only for protector.
Write a sentence Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Write a sentence What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
Write a sentence That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
Write a sentence Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
Write a sentence What else? and that succession be determined.
Write a sentence Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
Write a sentence But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
Write a sentence It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
Write a sentence My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
Write a sentence My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
Write a sentence Come hither, England's hope.
Write a sentence What news, my friend?
Write a sentence That Edward is escaped from your brother,
Write a sentence Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
Write a sentence He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
Write a sentence My brother was too careless of his charge.
Write a sentence My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
Write a sentence Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
Write a sentence It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Write a sentence Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Write a sentence The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
Write a sentence Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
Write a sentence My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
Write a sentence My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
Write a sentence But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Write a sentence True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
Write a sentence Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
Write a sentence Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Write a sentence Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
Write a sentence A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
Write a sentence The good old man would fain that all were well,
Write a sentence So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
Write a sentence Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Write a sentence Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
Write a sentence To help King Edward in his time of storm,
Write a sentence Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Write a sentence Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
Write a sentence Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
Write a sentence What talk you of debating? in few words,
Write a sentence Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
Write a sentence When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Write a sentence Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
Write a sentence And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Write a sentence Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
Write a sentence Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
Write a sentence Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Write a sentence Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
Write a sentence And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
Write a sentence Long live Edward the Fourth!
Write a sentence Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
Write a sentence What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
Write a sentence Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
Write a sentence A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Write a sentence In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
Write a sentence Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
Write a sentence In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
Write a sentence Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
Write a sentence Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
Write a sentence And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
Write a sentence Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
Write a sentence Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
Write a sentence Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Write a sentence The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
Write a sentence That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
Write a sentence Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
Write a sentence Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
Write a sentence Away betimes, before his forces join,
Write a sentence Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
Write a sentence By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
Write a sentence How far off is our brother Montague?
Write a sentence By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
Write a sentence Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
Write a sentence At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
Write a sentence Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
Write a sentence It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
Write a sentence Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
Write a sentence They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
Write a sentence Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
Write a sentence See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
Write a sentence O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
Write a sentence Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Write a sentence Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Write a sentence I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
Write a sentence Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
Write a sentence Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
Write a sentence 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
Write a sentence Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
Write a sentence Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
Write a sentence But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
Write a sentence Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
Write a sentence 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
Write a sentence Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
Write a sentence I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
Write a sentence Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
Write a sentence O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
Write a sentence Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
Write a sentence The gates are open, let us enter too.
Write a sentence So other foes may set upon our backs.
Write a sentence O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
Write a sentence Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
Write a sentence Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Write a sentence The harder match'd, the greater victory:
Write a sentence Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
Write a sentence Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Write a sentence And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
Write a sentence Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Write a sentence Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
Write a sentence Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
Write a sentence O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
Write a sentence What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
Write a sentence Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
Write a sentence Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Write a sentence So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
Write a sentence Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
Write a sentence Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
Write a sentence Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
Write a sentence Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
Write a sentence Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
Write a sentence Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
Write a sentence Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
Write a sentence A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
Write a sentence The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
Write a sentence We are advertised by our loving friends
Write a sentence Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
Write a sentence Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Write a sentence Women and children of so high a courage,
Write a sentence And he that will not fight for such a hope.
Write a sentence Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
Write a sentence And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
Write a sentence Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Write a sentence I thought no less: it is his policy
Write a sentence But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
Write a sentence This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
Write a sentence Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
Write a sentence Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Write a sentence Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
Write a sentence Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
Write a sentence For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
Write a sentence Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
Write a sentence So part we sadly in this troublous world,
Write a sentence Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Write a sentence It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
Write a sentence Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
Write a sentence Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
Write a sentence Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
Write a sentence That you might still have worn the petticoat,
Write a sentence Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
Write a sentence By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
Write a sentence Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
Write a sentence For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
Write a sentence Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
Write a sentence Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
Write a sentence Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
Write a sentence I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
Write a sentence Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
Write a sentence Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.
Write a sentence And there's for twitting me with perjury.
Write a sentence O, kill me too!
Write a sentence Marry, and shall.
Write a sentence Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.
Write a sentence Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
Write a sentence What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
Write a sentence Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
Write a sentence What? what?
Write a sentence The Tower, the Tower.
Write a sentence O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Write a sentence Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
Write a sentence Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
Write a sentence By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
Write a sentence Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
Write a sentence Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
Write a sentence Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
Write a sentence Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.
Write a sentence So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
Write a sentence Where's Richard gone?
Write a sentence To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
Write a sentence He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
Write a sentence Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
Write a sentence Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
Write a sentence Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
Write a sentence So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
Write a sentence Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
Write a sentence The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
Write a sentence Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
Write a sentence I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Write a sentence Think'st thou I am an executioner?
Write a sentence A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
Write a sentence Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
Write a sentence Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Write a sentence I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
Write a sentence Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
Write a sentence What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Write a sentence Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
Write a sentence Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
Write a sentence The duty that I owe unto your majesty
Write a sentence Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
Write a sentence And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Write a sentence Now am I seated as my soul delights,
Write a sentence What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Write a sentence Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
Write a sentence If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
Write a sentence I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
Write a sentence Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
Write a sentence Beseech you,--
Write a sentence Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
Write a sentence You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
Write a sentence Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
Write a sentence Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
Write a sentence I think there is not in the world either malice or
Write a sentence I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
Write a sentence Would they else be content to die?
Write a sentence Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
Write a sentence If the king had no son, they would desire to live
Write a sentence Nine changes of the watery star hath been
Write a sentence Stay your thanks a while;
Write a sentence Sir, that's to-morrow.
Write a sentence We are tougher, brother,
Write a sentence No longer stay.
Write a sentence One seven-night longer.
Write a sentence Very sooth, to-morrow.
Write a sentence We'll part the time between's then; and in that
Write a sentence Press me not, beseech you, so.
Write a sentence Tongue-tied, our queen?
Write a sentence I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
Write a sentence Well said, Hermione.
Write a sentence To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
Write a sentence No, madam.
Write a sentence Nay, but you will?
Write a sentence I may not, verily.
Write a sentence Verily!
Write a sentence Your guest, then, madam:
Write a sentence Not your gaoler, then,
Write a sentence We were, fair queen,
Write a sentence Was not my lord
Write a sentence We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
Write a sentence By this we gather
Write a sentence O my most sacred lady!
Write a sentence Grace to boot!
Write a sentence Is he won yet?
Write a sentence He'll stay my lord.
Write a sentence At my request he would not.
Write a sentence Never?
Write a sentence Never, but once.
Write a sentence What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
Write a sentence Why, that was when
Write a sentence 'Tis grace indeed.
Write a sentence Ay, my good lord.
Write a sentence I' fecks!
Write a sentence Yes, if you will, my lord.
Write a sentence Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
Write a sentence What means Sicilia?
Write a sentence He something seems unsettled.
Write a sentence How, my lord!
Write a sentence You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Write a sentence No, in good earnest.
Write a sentence No, my lord, I'll fight.
Write a sentence You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Write a sentence If at home, sir,
Write a sentence So stands this squire
Write a sentence If you would seek us,
Write a sentence To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Write a sentence I am like you, they say.
Write a sentence Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
Write a sentence Ay, my good lord.
Write a sentence Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Write a sentence You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
Write a sentence Didst note it?
Write a sentence He would not stay at your petitions: made
Write a sentence Didst perceive it?
Write a sentence At the good queen's entreaty.
Write a sentence At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
Write a sentence Business, my lord! I think most understand
Write a sentence Ha!
Write a sentence Stays here longer.
Write a sentence Ay, but why?
Write a sentence To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Write a sentence Satisfy!
Write a sentence Be it forbid, my lord!
Write a sentence To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
Write a sentence My gracious lord,
Write a sentence Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
Write a sentence I would not be a stander-by to hear
Write a sentence Is whispering nothing?
Write a sentence Good my lord, be cured
Write a sentence Say it be, 'tis true.
Write a sentence No, no, my lord.
Write a sentence It is; you lie, you lie:
Write a sentence Who does infect her?
Write a sentence Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
Write a sentence Sir, my lord,
Write a sentence Make that thy question, and go rot!
Write a sentence I must believe you, sir:
Write a sentence Thou dost advise me
Write a sentence My lord,
Write a sentence This is all:
Write a sentence I'll do't, my lord.
Write a sentence I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
Write a sentence O miserable lady! But, for me,
Write a sentence This is strange: methinks
Write a sentence Hail, most royal sir!
Write a sentence What is the news i' the court?
Write a sentence None rare, my lord.
Write a sentence The king hath on him such a countenance
Write a sentence I dare not know, my lord.
Write a sentence How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
Write a sentence There is a sickness
Write a sentence How! caught of me!
Write a sentence I may not answer.
Write a sentence A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
Write a sentence Sir, I will tell you;
Write a sentence On, good Camillo.
Write a sentence I am appointed him to murder you.
Write a sentence By whom, Camillo?
Write a sentence By the king.
Write a sentence For what?
Write a sentence He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
Write a sentence O, then my best blood turn
Write a sentence Swear his thought over
Write a sentence How should this grow?
Write a sentence I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Write a sentence I do believe thee:
Write a sentence It is in mine authority to command
Write a sentence Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
Write a sentence Come, my gracious lord,
Write a sentence No, I'll none of you.

Write a sentence Pray you, do.
Write a sentence Now, what's the matter. Provost?
Write a sentence Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

Write a sentence Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
Write a sentence Pray you, be gone.
Write a sentence I would to heaven I had your potency,
Write a sentence Your brother is a forfeit of the law,

Write a sentence Be you content, fair maid;
Write a sentence To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
Write a sentence The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:

Write a sentence I show it most of all when I show justice;
Write a sentence So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
Write a sentence Could great men thunder
Write a sentence We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Write a sentence Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
Write a sentence That in the captain's but a choleric word,

Write a sentence Well; come to me to-morrow.
Write a sentence Heaven keep your honour safe!
Write a sentence At what hour to-morrow
Write a sentence At any time 'fore noon.
Write a sentence 'Save your honour!
Write a sentence From thee, even from thy virtue!
Write a sentence Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
Write a sentence I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
Write a sentence Bound by my charity and my blest order,
Write a sentence I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Write a sentence When must he die?
Write a sentence As I do think, to-morrow.
Write a sentence Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
Write a sentence I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
Write a sentence I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
Write a sentence I'll gladly learn.
Write a sentence Love you the man that wrong'd you?
Write a sentence Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
Write a sentence So then it seems your most offenceful act
Write a sentence Mutually.
Write a sentence Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
Write a sentence I do confess it, and repent it, father.
Write a sentence 'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
Write a sentence I do repent me, as it is an evil,

Write a sentence 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
Write a sentence Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Write a sentence Sir, believe this,
Write a sentence I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Write a sentence How say you?
Write a sentence Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Write a sentence Please you to do't,
Write a sentence Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Write a sentence That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Write a sentence Nay, but hear me.
Write a sentence Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
Write a sentence Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
Write a sentence So.
Write a sentence And his offence is so, as it appears,
Write a sentence True.
Write a sentence Admit no other way to save his life,--
Write a sentence As much for my poor brother as myself:
Write a sentence Then must your brother die.
Write a sentence And 'twere the cheaper way:
Write a sentence Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
Write a sentence Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Write a sentence You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
Write a sentence O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
Write a sentence We are all frail.
Write a sentence Else let my brother die,
Write a sentence Nay, women are frail too.
Write a sentence Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Write a sentence I think it well:
Write a sentence I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Write a sentence Plainly conceive, I love you.
Write a sentence My brother did love Juliet,
Write a sentence He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
Write a sentence I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Write a sentence Believe me, on mine honour,
Write a sentence Ha! little honour to be much believed,
Write a sentence Who will believe thee, Isabel?
Write a sentence To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Write a sentence So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
Write a sentence The miserable have no other medicine
Write a sentence Be absolute for death; either death or life
Write a sentence I humbly thank you.
Write a sentence Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
Write a sentence Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
Write a sentence Most holy sir, I thank you.
Write a sentence My business is a word or two with Claudio.
Write a sentence And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
Write a sentence Provost, a word with you.
Write a sentence As many as you please.
Write a sentence Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
Write a sentence Now, sister, what's the comfort?
Write a sentence Why,
Write a sentence Is there no remedy?
Write a sentence None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
Write a sentence But is there any?
Write a sentence Yes, brother, you may live:
Write a sentence Perpetual durance?
Write a sentence Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Write a sentence But in what nature?
Write a sentence In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Write a sentence Let me know the point.
Write a sentence O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Write a sentence Why give you me this shame?
Write a sentence There spake my brother; there my father's grave

Write a sentence Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
Write a sentence Thou shalt not do't.
Write a sentence O, were it but my life,
Write a sentence Thanks, dear Isabel.
Write a sentence Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
Write a sentence Yes. Has he affections in him,
Write a sentence Which is the least?
Write a sentence If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Write a sentence What says my brother?
Write a sentence Death is a fearful thing.
Write a sentence And shamed life a hateful.
Write a sentence Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
Write a sentence Alas, alas!
Write a sentence Sweet sister, let me live:
Write a sentence O you beast!
Write a sentence Nay, hear me, Isabel.
Write a sentence O, fie, fie, fie!
Write a sentence O hear me, Isabella!
Write a sentence Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
Write a sentence What is your will?
Write a sentence Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
Write a sentence I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
Write a sentence Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
Write a sentence Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
Write a sentence Hold you there: farewell.
Write a sentence What's your will, father
Write a sentence That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
Write a sentence In good time.
Write a sentence The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:

Write a sentence She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
Write a sentence Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
Write a sentence Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
Write a sentence What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid

Write a sentence And you.
Write a sentence Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

Write a sentence A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
Write a sentence It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
Write a sentence Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;

Write a sentence Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
Write a sentence A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;

Write a sentence Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
Write a sentence Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
Write a sentence By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
Write a sentence Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
Write a sentence In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
Write a sentence I guess not.
Write a sentence And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his

Write a sentence Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
Write a sentence Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
Write a sentence And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Write a sentence I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
Write a sentence You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
Write a sentence You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
Write a sentence You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
Write a sentence I see you do not mean to part with her,
Write a sentence Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Write a sentence Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
Write a sentence I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
Write a sentence Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Write a sentence O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
Write a sentence I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
Write a sentence A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Write a sentence Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
Write a sentence Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
Write a sentence Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
Write a sentence A mighty man of Pisa; by report
Write a sentence Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
Write a sentence After my death the one half of my lands,
Write a sentence And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Write a sentence Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
Write a sentence Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
Write a sentence Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
Write a sentence Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
Write a sentence How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
Write a sentence For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
Write a sentence What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
Write a sentence I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Write a sentence Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
Write a sentence Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
Write a sentence Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
Write a sentence Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Write a sentence I pray you do.
Write a sentence Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
Write a sentence You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
Write a sentence Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Write a sentence Why, what's a moveable?
Write a sentence A join'd-stool.
Write a sentence Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
Write a sentence Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
Write a sentence Women are made to bear, and so are you.
Write a sentence No such jade as you, if me you mean.
Write a sentence Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
Write a sentence Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
Write a sentence Should be! should--buzz!
Write a sentence Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
Write a sentence O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
Write a sentence Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
Write a sentence Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
Write a sentence If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
Write a sentence My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
Write a sentence Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
Write a sentence Who knows not where a wasp does
Write a sentence In his tongue.
Write a sentence Whose tongue?
Write a sentence Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
Write a sentence What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Write a sentence That I'll try.
Write a sentence I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
Write a sentence So may you lose your arms:
Write a sentence A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
Write a sentence What is your crest? a coxcomb?
Write a sentence A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
Write a sentence No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
Write a sentence Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
Write a sentence It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
Write a sentence Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
Write a sentence There is, there is.
Write a sentence Then show it me.
Write a sentence Had I a glass, I would.
Write a sentence What, you mean my face?
Write a sentence Well aim'd of such a young one.
Write a sentence Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
Write a sentence Yet you are wither'd.
Write a sentence 'Tis with cares.
Write a sentence I care not.
Write a sentence Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
Write a sentence I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
Write a sentence No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
Write a sentence Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
Write a sentence Did ever Dian so become a grove
Write a sentence Where did you study all this goodly speech?
Write a sentence It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
Write a sentence A witty mother! witless else her son.
Write a sentence Am I not wise?
Write a sentence Yes; keep you warm.
Write a sentence Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
Write a sentence Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
Write a sentence How but well, sir? how but well?
Write a sentence Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
Write a sentence Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
Write a sentence Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
Write a sentence I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
Write a sentence Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
Write a sentence Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
Write a sentence Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
Write a sentence I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
Write a sentence Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
Write a sentence Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
Write a sentence Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
Write a sentence Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
Write a sentence 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
Write a sentence The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
Write a sentence No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
Write a sentence And I am one that love Bianca more
Write a sentence Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
Write a sentence Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
Write a sentence But thine doth fry.
Write a sentence But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
Write a sentence Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
Write a sentence First, as you know, my house within the city
Write a sentence That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
Write a sentence Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
Write a sentence Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Write a sentence Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
Write a sentence Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
Write a sentence I must confess your offer is the best;
Write a sentence That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
Write a sentence And may not young men die, as well as old?
Write a sentence Well, gentlemen,
Write a sentence Adieu, good neighbour.
Write a sentence A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Write a sentence Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Write a sentence But, wrangling pedant, this is
Write a sentence Preposterous ass, that never read so far
Write a sentence Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
Write a sentence Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
Write a sentence You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
Write a sentence That will be never: tune your instrument.
Write a sentence Where left we last?
Write a sentence Here, madam:
Write a sentence Construe them.
Write a sentence 'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Write a sentence Madam, my instrument's in tune.
Write a sentence Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
Write a sentence Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
Write a sentence Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Write a sentence Madam, 'tis now in tune.
Write a sentence All but the base.
Write a sentence The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
Write a sentence In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
Write a sentence Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Write a sentence I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
Write a sentence You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
Write a sentence Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
Write a sentence Madam, before you touch the instrument,
Write a sentence Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
Write a sentence Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
Write a sentence Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
Write a sentence Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
Write a sentence Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
Write a sentence But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Write a sentence No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
Write a sentence Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Write a sentence Would Katharina had never seen him though!
Write a sentence Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
Write a sentence Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
Write a sentence Is it new and old too? how may that be?
Write a sentence Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
Write a sentence Is he come?
Write a sentence Why, no, sir.
Write a sentence What then?
Write a sentence He is coming.
Write a sentence When will he be here?
Write a sentence When he stands where I am and sees you there.
Write a sentence But say, what to thine old news?
Write a sentence Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
Write a sentence Who comes with him?
Write a sentence O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
Write a sentence 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Write a sentence I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
Write a sentence Why, sir, he comes not.
Write a sentence Didst thou not say he comes?
Write a sentence Who? that Petruchio came?
Write a sentence Ay, that Petruchio came.
Write a sentence No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
Write a sentence Why, that's all one.
Write a sentence Nay, by Saint Jamy,
Write a sentence Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
Write a sentence You are welcome, sir.
Write a sentence And yet I come not well.
Write a sentence And yet you halt not.
Write a sentence Not so well apparell'd
Write a sentence Were it better, I should rush in thus.
Write a sentence Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
Write a sentence And tells us, what occasion of import
Write a sentence Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Write a sentence See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Write a sentence Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
Write a sentence But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
Write a sentence Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
Write a sentence He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
Write a sentence I'll after him, and see the event of this.
Write a sentence But to her love concerneth us to add
Write a sentence Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Write a sentence That by degrees we mean to look into,
Write a sentence As willingly as e'er I came from school.
Write a sentence And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
Write a sentence A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
Write a sentence Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
Write a sentence Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
Write a sentence Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
Write a sentence Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
Write a sentence What said the wench when he rose again?
Write a sentence Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
Write a sentence Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
Write a sentence Is't possible you will away to-night?
Write a sentence I must away to-day, before night come:
Write a sentence Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
Write a sentence It may not be.
Write a sentence Let me entreat you.
Write a sentence It cannot be.
Write a sentence Let me entreat you.
Write a sentence I am content.
Write a sentence Are you content to stay?
Write a sentence I am content you shall entreat me stay;
Write a sentence Now, if you love me, stay.
Write a sentence Grumio, my horse.
Write a sentence Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
Write a sentence Nay, then,
Write a sentence O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
Write a sentence I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Write a sentence Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
Write a sentence Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
Write a sentence They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Write a sentence Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
Write a sentence Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
Write a sentence Of all mad matches never was the like.
Write a sentence Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
Write a sentence That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
Write a sentence I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
Write a sentence Neighbours and friends, though bride and
Write a sentence Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
Write a sentence She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
Write a sentence Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
Write a sentence Who is that calls so coldly?
Write a sentence A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
Write a sentence Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
Write a sentence O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
Write a sentence Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
Write a sentence She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
Write a sentence Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
Write a sentence Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
Write a sentence I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
Write a sentence A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
Write a sentence There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
Write a sentence Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
Write a sentence Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
Write a sentence Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Write a sentence All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
Write a sentence First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
Write a sentence How?
Write a sentence Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
Write a sentence Let's ha't, good Grumio.
Write a sentence Lend thine ear.
Write a sentence Here.
Write a sentence There.
Write a sentence This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
Write a sentence And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
Write a sentence Both of one horse?
Write a sentence What's that to thee?
Write a sentence Why, a horse.
Write a sentence Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
Write a sentence By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
Write a sentence Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
Write a sentence They are.
Write a sentence Call them forth.
Write a sentence Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
Write a sentence Why, she hath a face of her own.
Write a sentence Who knows not that?
Write a sentence Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
Write a sentence I call them forth to credit her.
Write a sentence Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
Write a sentence Welcome home, Grumio!
Write a sentence How now, Grumio!
Write a sentence What, Grumio!
Write a sentence Fellow Grumio!
Write a sentence How now, old lad?
Write a sentence Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
Write a sentence All things is ready. How near is our master?
Write a sentence E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
Write a sentence Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
Write a sentence Here, here, sir; here, sir.
Write a sentence Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
Write a sentence Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
Write a sentence You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Write a sentence Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
Write a sentence Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Write a sentence Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
Write a sentence A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Write a sentence Ay.
Write a sentence Who brought it?
Write a sentence I.
Write a sentence 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
Write a sentence I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
Write a sentence I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
Write a sentence Peter, didst ever see the like?
Write a sentence He kills her in her own humour.
Write a sentence Where is he?
Write a sentence In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
Write a sentence Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
Write a sentence Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Write a sentence Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Write a sentence Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
Write a sentence What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
Write a sentence I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
Write a sentence And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
Write a sentence While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
Write a sentence Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
Write a sentence O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
Write a sentence Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Write a sentence Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Write a sentence See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Write a sentence And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Write a sentence Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
Write a sentence Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
Write a sentence Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
Write a sentence Mistress, we have.
Write a sentence Then we are rid of Licio.
Write a sentence I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
Write a sentence God give him joy!
Write a sentence Ay, and he'll tame her.
Write a sentence He says so, Tranio.
Write a sentence Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
Write a sentence The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
Write a sentence Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
Write a sentence O master, master, I have watch'd so long
Write a sentence What is he, Biondello?
Write a sentence Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
Write a sentence And what of him, Tranio?
Write a sentence If he be credulous and trust my tale,
Write a sentence God save you, sir!
Write a sentence And you, sir! you are welcome.
Write a sentence Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
Write a sentence What countryman, I pray?
Write a sentence Of Mantua.
Write a sentence Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
Write a sentence My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
Write a sentence 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
Write a sentence Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
Write a sentence Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
Write a sentence Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Write a sentence Among them know you one Vincentio?
Write a sentence I know him not, but I have heard of him;
Write a sentence He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
Write a sentence To save your life in this extremity,
Write a sentence O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
Write a sentence Then go with me to make the matter good.
Write a sentence No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
Write a sentence The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
Write a sentence What say you to a neat's foot?
Write a sentence 'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
Write a sentence I fear it is too choleric a meat.
Write a sentence I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
Write a sentence I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
Write a sentence A dish that I do love to feed upon.
Write a sentence Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
Write a sentence Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
Write a sentence Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Write a sentence Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
Write a sentence Why then, the mustard without the beef.
Write a sentence Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
Write a sentence How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
Write a sentence Mistress, what cheer?
Write a sentence Faith, as cold as can be.
Write a sentence Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Write a sentence I pray you, let it stand.
Write a sentence The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
Write a sentence I thank you, sir.
Write a sentence Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Write a sentence Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
Write a sentence Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
Write a sentence I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
Write a sentence When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
Write a sentence Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
Write a sentence Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
Write a sentence Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
Write a sentence Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
Write a sentence You bid me make it orderly and well,
Write a sentence Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
Write a sentence I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
Write a sentence Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
Write a sentence She says your worship means to make
Write a sentence O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
Write a sentence Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Write a sentence I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
Write a sentence But how did you desire it should be made?
Write a sentence Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
Write a sentence But did you not request to have it cut?
Write a sentence Thou hast faced many things.
Write a sentence I have.
Write a sentence Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
Write a sentence Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
Write a sentence Read it.
Write a sentence The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
Write a sentence Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
Write a sentence Proceed.
Write a sentence I confess the cape.
Write a sentence I confess two sleeves.
Write a sentence Ay, there's the villany.
Write a sentence Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
Write a sentence This is true that I say: an I had thee
Write a sentence I am for thee straight: take thou the
Write a sentence God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.
Write a sentence Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
Write a sentence You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
Write a sentence Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
Write a sentence Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
Write a sentence Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
Write a sentence O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Write a sentence Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Write a sentence Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Write a sentence I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
Write a sentence It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Write a sentence Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
Write a sentence Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Write a sentence 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
Write a sentence I warrant you.
Write a sentence Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Write a sentence Tut, fear not me.
Write a sentence But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
Write a sentence I told him that your father was at Venice,
Write a sentence Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Write a sentence Soft son!
Write a sentence Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
Write a sentence I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
Write a sentence Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Write a sentence Then at my lodging, an it like you:
Write a sentence It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
Write a sentence I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
Write a sentence Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Write a sentence I follow you.
Write a sentence Cambio!
Write a sentence What sayest thou, Biondello?
Write a sentence You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
Write a sentence Biondello, what of that?
Write a sentence Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
Write a sentence I pray thee, moralize them.
Write a sentence Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
Write a sentence And what of him?
Write a sentence His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
Write a sentence And then?
Write a sentence The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
Write a sentence And what of all this?
Write a sentence I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
Write a sentence Hearest thou, Biondello?
Write a sentence I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
Write a sentence I may, and will, if she be so contented:
Write a sentence Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Write a sentence The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
Write a sentence I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
Write a sentence I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
Write a sentence Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
Write a sentence Say as he says, or we shall never go.
Write a sentence Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
Write a sentence I say it is the moon.
Write a sentence I know it is the moon.
Write a sentence Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
Write a sentence Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
Write a sentence Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
Write a sentence Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
Write a sentence A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
Write a sentence Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Write a sentence Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
Write a sentence Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
Write a sentence Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Write a sentence Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
Write a sentence What is his name?
Write a sentence Lucentio, gentle sir.
Write a sentence Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
Write a sentence But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
Write a sentence I do assure thee, father, so it is.
Write a sentence Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
Write a sentence Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Write a sentence Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
Write a sentence I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
Write a sentence Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
Write a sentence I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Write a sentence Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
Write a sentence You shall not choose but drink before you go:
Write a sentence They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
Write a sentence What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
Write a sentence Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
Write a sentence He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
Write a sentence What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
Write a sentence Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
Write a sentence Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Write a sentence Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
Write a sentence Art thou his father?
Write a sentence Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
Write a sentence Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
Write a sentence I have seen them in the church together: God send
Write a sentence Hope I may choose, sir.
Write a sentence Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
Write a sentence Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
Write a sentence What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
Write a sentence What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
Write a sentence Is't so, indeed.
Write a sentence Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
Write a sentence Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
Write a sentence Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
Write a sentence Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
Write a sentence What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
Write a sentence How now! what's the matter?
Write a sentence What, is the man lunatic?
Write a sentence Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
Write a sentence Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Write a sentence You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
Write a sentence His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
Write a sentence Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
Write a sentence Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
Write a sentence Call forth an officer.
Write a sentence Carry me to the gaol!
Write a sentence Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
Write a sentence Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
Write a sentence Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
Write a sentence Swear, if thou darest.
Write a sentence Nay, I dare not swear it.
Write a sentence Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
Write a sentence Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
Write a sentence Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
Write a sentence Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
Write a sentence O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
Write a sentence Lives my sweet son?
Write a sentence Pardon, dear father.
Write a sentence How hast thou offended?
